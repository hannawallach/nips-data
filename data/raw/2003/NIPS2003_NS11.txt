Abstract When we learn a new motor skill, we have to contend with both the variability inherent in our sensors and the task. The sensory uncertainty can be reduced by using information about the distribution of previously experienced tasks. Here we impose a distribution on a novel sensorimotor task and manipulate the variability of the sensory feedback. We show that subjects internally represent both the distribution of the task as well as their sensory uncertainty. Moreover, they combine these two sources of information in a way that is qualitatively predicted by optimal Bayesian processing. We further analyze if the subjects can represent multimodal distributions such as mixtures of Gaussians. The results show that the CNS employs probabilistic models during sensorimotor learning even when the priors are multimodal.

1 Introduction Real world motor tasks are inherently uncertain. For example, when we try to play an approaching tennis ball, our vision of the ball does not provide perfect information about its velocity. Due to this sensory uncertainty we can only generate an estimate of the ball's velocity. This uncertainty can be reduced by taking into account information that is available on a longer time scale: not all velocities are a priori equally probable. For example, very fast and very slow balls may be experienced less often than medium paced balls. Over the course of a match there will be a probability distribution of velocities. Bayesian theory [1-2] tells us that to make an optimal estimate of the velocity of a given ball, this a priori information about the distribution of velocities should be combined with the evidence provided by sensory feedback. This combination process requires prior knowledge, how probable each possible velocity is, and knowledge of the uncertainty inherent in the sensory estimate of velocity. As the degree of uncertainty in the feedback increases, for example when playing in fog or at dusk, an optimal system should increasingly depend on prior knowledge. Here we examine whether subjects represent the probability distribution of a task and if this can be appropriately combined with an estimate of sensory uncer-

tainty. Moreover, we examine whether subjects can represent priors that have multimodal distributions. 2 Experiment 1: Gaussian Prior To examine whether subjects can represent a prior distribution of a task and integrate it with a measure of their sensory uncertainty we examined performance on a reaching task. The perceived position of the hand is displaced relative to the real position of the hand. This displacement or shift is drawn randomly from an underlying probability distribution and subjects have to estimate this shift to perform well on the task. By examining where subjects reached while manipulating the reliability of their visual feedback we distinguished between several models of sensorimotor learning. 2.1 Methods Ten subjects made reaching movement on a table to a visual target with their right index finger in a virtual reality setup (for details of the set-up see [6]). An Optotrak 3020 measured the position of their finger and a projection/mirror system prevented direct view of their arm and allowed us to generate a cursor representing their finger position which was displayed in the plane of the movement (Figure 1A). As the finger moved from the starting circle, the cursor was extinguished and shifted laterally from the true finger location by an amount ÜØÖÙ which was drawn each trial from a Gaussian distribution:

After this period, when to the left of the target showing that they had learned the average shift of 1 cm experienced over the trials. Subsequently, we examined the relationship between visual feedback and was compensation during the second half of the movement.

2.3 Computational Models and Predictions There are several computational models which subjects could use to determine the compensation needed to reach the target based on the sensed location of the finger midway through the movement.

which is always less than the MSE for model 1. As we increase the blur, and thus the degree of uncertainty, the estimate of the shift moves away from the visually sensed displacement strategy thus allows subjects to minimize the MSE at the target. 3) Mapping model. A third computational strategy is to learn a mapping from the sensed many trials the subjects could achieve a combination similar to model 2 but without any representation of the prior distribution or the visual uncertainty. However, to learn such a mapping requires visual feedback and knowledge of the error at the end of the movement. In our experiment we only revealed the shifted position of the finger at the end of the

only do so for these trials and apply the same mapping to the blurred conditions (

Therefore, this model predicts that the average lateral shift ÜØÖÙ independent of the degree of blur (Figure 1E right panel) 2.3.1 Results: Lateral Deviation

Moreover, this transition from using feedback to using prior information occurs gradually with increasing uncertainty as also predicted by this Bayesian model. These effects are consistent over all the subjects tested. The slope increases with increasing uncertainty in the visual feedback (Figure 2B). Depending on the uncertainty of the feedback, subjects thus combine prior knowledge of the distribution of shifts with new evidence to generate the optimal compensatory movement. Using Bayesian theory we can furthermore infer the degree of uncertainty from the errors

the subjects made. Given the width of the prior ÔÖ ÓÖ ¼

Since Ô must approach zero for both very small and very large Ü ØÖÙ , we subtract the mean of the right hand side before integrating numerically to obtain an estimate the prior Ô´ÜØÖÙ µ. Figure 2C shows the priors inferred for each subject and condition. This shows that the real prior (red line) was reliably learned by each subject. 3 Experiment 2: Mixture of Gaussians Priors The second experiment was designed to examine whether subjects are able to represent more complicated priors such as mixtures of Gaussians and if they can utilize such prior knowledge.


3.1 Methods 12 additional subjects participated in an experiment similar to Experiment 1 with the following changes. The experiments lasted for twice as many trials run on two consecutive days with 2000 trials performed on each day. Feedback midway through the movement was always blurred (spheres distributed as a two dimensional Gaussian with Ñ)and feedback at the end of the movement was provided on every trial. The prior distribution was a mixture of Gaussians ( Figure 3A,D). One group of 6 subjects was exposed to:

To estimate the priors learned by the subjects we fitted and compared two models.

This result shows that subjects can not fully learn this more complicated distribution but rather just learn some of its properties. This could be due to several effects. First, large values of ÜØÖÙ are experienced only rarely. Second, it could be that subjects use a simpler model such as a generalized Gaussian (the family of distribution that also the Laplacian distribution belongs to) or that they use a mixture of only a few Gaussians model. Third, subjects could have a prior over priors that makes a mixture of three Gaussians model very unlikely. Learning such a mixture would therefore be expected to take far longer. 3.4 Results: Evolution of the Subjects Performance

Figure 4: Aµ The mean error over the 6 subjects is shown as a function of the trial number Bµ The average lateral deviation as a function of the shift and the trial number Cµ The additional variance explained by the full model is plotted as a function of the trial number As a next step we wanted to analyze how the behaviour of the subjects changes over the


course of training. During the process of training the average error over batches of 500 subsequent trials decreased from 1.97 cm to 0.84 cm (Figure 4A). What change leads to this decrease? To address this we plot the evolution of the lateral deviation graph, as a function of the trial number (Figure 4B). Subjects initially exhibit a slope of about 1 and approximately linear behaviour. This indicates that initially they are using a narrow Gaussian prior. In other words they rely on the prior belief that their hand will not be displaced and ignore the feedback. Only later during training do they show behaviour that is consistent with a bimodal Gaussians distribution. In Figure 4C we plot the percentage of additional variance explained by the full model when compared to the Gaussian model averaged over the population. It seems that in particular after trial 2000, the trial after which people enjoy a nights rest, does the explanatory power of the full model improve. It could be that subjects need a consolidation period to adequately learn the distribution. Such improvements in learning contingent upon sleep have also been observed in visual learning [7]. 4 Conclusion We have shown that a prior is used by humans to determine appropriate motor commands and that it is combined with an estimate of sensory uncertainty. Such a Bayesian view of sensorimotor learning is consistent with neurophysiological studies that show that the brain represents the degree of uncertainty when estimating rewards [8-10] and with psychophysical studies addressing the timing of movements [11]. Not only do people represent the uncertainty and combine this with prior information, they are also able to represent and utilize complicated nongaussian priors. Optimally using a priori knowledge might be key to winning a tennis match. Tennis professionals spend a great deal of time studying their opponent before playing an important match - ensuring that they start the match with correct a priori knowledge.
