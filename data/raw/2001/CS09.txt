Abstract
A theory of categorization is presented in which knowledge of
causal relationships between category features is represented as a
Bayesian network. Referred to as causal­model theory, this theory
predicts that objects are classified as category members to the
extent they are likely to have been produced by a category s causal
model. On this view, people have models of the world that lead
them to expect a certain distribution of features in category
members (e.g., correlations between feature pairs that are directly
connected by causal relationships), and consider exemplars good
category members when they manifest those expectations. These
expectations include sensitivity to higher­order feature interactions
that emerge from the asymmetries inherent in causal relationships.
Research on the topic of categorization has traditionally focused on the problem of
learning new categories given observations of category members. In contrast, the
theory­based view of categories emphasizes the influence of the prior theoretical
knowledge that learners often contribute to their representations of categories [1].
However, in contrast to models accounting for the effects of empirical observations,
there have been few models developed to account for the effects of prior knowledge.
The purpose of this article is to present a model of categorization referred to as
causal­model theory or CMT [2, 3]. According to CMT, people's knowledge of
many categories includes not only features, but also an explicit representation of the
causal mechanisms that people believe link the features of many categories.
In this article I apply CMT to the problem of establishing objects category
membership. In the psychological literature one standard view of categorization is
that objects are placed in a category to the extent they have features that have often
been observed in members of that category. For example, an object that has most of
the features of birds (e.g., wings, fly, build nests in trees, etc.) and few features of
other categories is thought to be a bird. This view of categorization is formalized by
prototype models in which classification is a function of the similarity (i.e., number
of shared features) between a mental representation of a category prototype and a
to­be­classified object. However, a well­known difficulty with prototype models is
that a feature s contribution to category membership is independent of the presence
or absence of other features. In contrast, consideration of a category s theoretical
knowledge is likely to influence which combinations of features make for
acceptable category members. For example, people believe that birds have nests in
trees because they can fly, and in light of this knowledge an animal that doesn t fly

and yet still builds nests in trees might be considered a less plausible bird than an
animal that builds nests on the ground and doesn t fly (e.g., an ostrich) even though
the latter animal has fewer features typical of birds.
To assess whether knowledge in fact influences which feature combinations make
for good category members, in the following experiment undergraduates were taught
novel categories whose four binary features exhibited either a common­cause or a
common­effect schema (Figure 1). In the common­cause schema, one category
feature (F 1 ) is described as causing the three other features (F 2 , F 3 , and F 4 ). In the
common­effect schema one feature (F 4 ) is described as being caused by the three
others (F 1 , F 2 , and F 3 ). CMT assumes that people represent causal knowledge such
as that in Figure 1 as a kind of Bayesian network [4] in which nodes are variables
representing binary category features and directed edges are causal relationships
representing the presence of probabilistic causal mechanisms between features.
Specifically, CMT assumes that when a cause feature is present it enables the
operation of a causal mechanism that will, with some probability m, bring about the
presence of the effect feature. CMT also allow for the possibility that effect features
have potential background causes that are not explicitly represented in the network,
as represented by parameter b which is the probability that an effect will be present
even when its network causes are absent. Finally, each cause node has a parameter c
that represents the probability that a cause feature will be present.

The central prediction of CMT is that an object is considered to be a category
member to the extent that its features were likely to have been generated by a
category's causal mechanisms. For example, Table 1 presents the likelihoods that
the causal models of Figure 1 will generate the sixteen possible combinations of F 1 ,
F 2 , F 3 , and F 4 . Each likelihood equation can be derived by the application of simple
Boolean algebra operations. For example, the probability of exemplar 1101 (F 1 , F 2 ,
F 4 present, F 3 absent) being generated by a common­cause model is the probability
that F 1 is present [c], times the probability that F 2 was brought about by F 1 or its
background cause [1---(1---m)(1---b)], times the probability that F 3 was brought about
by neither F 1 nor its background cause [(1---m)(1---b)], times the probability that F 4
was brought about by F 1 or its background cause [1---(1---m)(1---b)]. Likewise, the
probability of exemplar 1011 (F 1 , F 3 , F 4 present, F 2 absent) being generated by a
common­effect model is the probability that F 1 and F 3 are present [c 2 ], times the
probability that F 2 is absent [1---c], times the probability that F 4 was brought about
by F 1 , F 3 , or its background cause [1---(1---m)(1---m)(1---b)]. Note that these likelihoods
assume that the causal mechanisms in each model operate independently and with
the same probability m, restrictions that can be relaxed in other applications.
This formalization of categorization offered by CMT implies that people s
theoretical knowledge leads them to expect a certain distribution of features in
category members, and that they use this information when assigning category
membership. Thus, to gain insight into the categorization performance predicted by
CMT, we can examine the statistical properties of category features that one can

expect to be generated by a causal model. For example, dotted lines in Figure 2
represent the features correlations that are generated from the causal schemas of
Figure 1. As one would expect, pairs of features directly linked by causal
relationships are correlated in the common­cause schema F 1 is correlated with its
effects and in the common­effect schema F 4 is correlated with its causes. Thus,
CMT predicts that combinations of features serve as evidence for category
membership to the extent that they preserve these expected correlations (i.e., both
cause and effect present or both absent), and against category membership to the
extent that they break those correlations (one present and the other absent).

Causal networks not only predict pairwise correlations between directly connected
features. Figure 2 indicates that as a result of the asymmetries inherent in causal
relationships there is an important disanalogy between the common­cause and
common­effect schemas: Although the common­cause schema implies that the three
effects (F 2 , F 3 , F 4 ) will be correlated (albeit more weakly than directly connected
features), the common­effect schema does not imply that the three causes (F 1 , F 2 ,
F 3 ) will be correlated. This asymmetry between common­cause and common­effect
schemas has been the focus of considerable investigation in the philosophical and
psychological literatures [3, 5]. Use of these schemas in the following experiment
enables a test of whether categorizers are sensitive the pattern of correlations
between features directly­connected by causal laws, and also those that arise due to
the asymmetries inherent in causal relationships shown in Figure 2. Moreover, I will
show that CMT predicts, and humans exhibit, sensitivity to interactions among
features of a higher­order than the pairwise interactions shown in Figure 2.
Method
Six novel categories were used in which the description of causal relationships
between features consisted of one sentence indicating the cause and effect feature,
and then one or two sentences describing the mechanism responsible for the causal
relationship. For example, one of the novel categories, Lake Victoria Shrimp, was
described as having four binary features (e.g., A high quantity of ACh
neurotransmitter. , Long­lasting flight response. , Accelerated sleep cycle. , etc.)

and causal relationships among those features (e.g., "A high quantity of ACh
neurotransmitter causes a long­lasting flight response. The duration of the electrical
signal to the muscles is longer because of the excess amount of neurotransmitter.").
Participants first studied several computer screens of information about their
assigned category at their own pace. All participants were first presented with the
category s four features. Participants in the common­cause condition were
additionally instructed on the common­cause causal relationships (F 1 ®F 2 , F 1 ®F 3 ,
F 1 ®F 4 ), and participants in the common­effect condition were instructed on the
common­effect relationships (F 1 ®F 4 , F 2 ®F 4 , F 3 ®F 4 ). When ready, participants
took a multiple­choice test that tested them on the knowledge they had just studied.
Participants were required to retake the test until they committed 0 errors.
Participants then performed a classification task in which they rated on a 0­100
scale the category membership of 16 exemplars, consisting of all possible objects
that can be formed from four binary features. For example, those participants
assigned to learn the Lake Victoria Shrimp category were asked to classify a shrimp
that possessed "High amounts of the ACh neurotransmitter," "A normal flight
response," "Accelerated sleep cycle," and "Normal body weight." The order of the
test exemplars was randomized for each participant.
One hundred and eight University of Illinois undergraduates received course credit
for participating in this experiment. They were randomly assigned in equal numbers
to the three conditions, and to one of the six experimental categories.
Resu l t s
Categorization ratings for the 16 test exemplars averaged over participants in the
common­cause, common­effect, and control conditions are presented in Table 1.
The presence of causal knowledge had a large effect on the ratings. For instance,
exemplars 0111 and 0001 were given lower ratings in the common­cause and
common­effect conditions, respectively (39.4 and 26.3) than in the control condition
(67.6 and 67.0) presumably because in these exemplars correlations are broken
(effect features are present even though their causes are absent). In contrast,
exemplar 1111 received a significantly higher rating in the common­cause and
common­effect conditions than in the control condition (90.8 and 91.0 vs. 75.6),
presumably because in both conditions all correlations are preserved.
To confirm that causal schemas induced a sensitivity to interactions between
features, categorization ratings were analyzed by performing a multiple regression
for each participant. Four predictor variables (f 1 , f 2 , f 3 , f 4 ) were coded as ­1 if the
feature was absent, and +1 if it was present. An additional six predictor variables
were formed from the multiplicative interaction between pairs of features: f 12 , f 13 ,
f 14 , f 24 , f 34 , and f 23 . For those feature pairs connected by a causal relationship the
two­way interaction terms represent whether the causal relationship is confirmed
(+1, cause and effect both present or both absent) or violated (­1, one present and
one absent). Finally, the four three­way interactions (f 123 , f 124 , f 134 , and f 234 ), and
the single four­way interaction (f 1234 ) were also included as predictors.
Regression weights averaged over participants are presented in Figure 3 as a
function of causal schema condition. Figure 3 indicates that the interaction terms
corresponding to those feature pairs assigned causal relationships had significantly
positive weights in both the common­cause condition (f 12 , f 13 , f 14 ), and the
common­effect condition (f 14 , f 24 , f 34 ). That is, as predicted (Figure 2) an exemplar
was rated a better category member when it preserved expected correlations (cause
and effect feature either both present or both absent), and a worse member when it
broke those correlations (one absent and the other present).

Figure 3
In addition, it was shown earlier (Figure 2) that because of their common­cause the
three effect features in a common­cause schema will be correlated, albeit more
weakly than directly­linked features. Consistent with this prediction, in this
condition the three two­way interaction terms between the effect features (f 24 , f 34 ,
f 23 ) are greater than those interactions in the control condition. In contrast, the
common­effect schema does not imply that the three cause features will be
correlated, and in fact in that condition the interactions between the cause attributes
(f 12 , f 13 , f 23 ) did not differ from those in the control condition (Figure 3).
Figure 3 also reveals higher­order interactions among features in the common­effect
condition: Weights on interaction terms f 124 , f 134 , f 234 , and f 1234 (---1.6, ­2.0, ­2.0,
and 2.2) were significantly different from those in the control condition. These
higher­order interactions arose because a common­effect schema requires only one
cause feature to explain the presence of the common effect. Figures 7b presents
the logarithm of the ratings in the common­effect condition for those test exemplars
in which the common effect is present as a function of the number of cause features
present. Ratings increased
more with the introduction
of the first cause as
compared to subsequent
causes. That is, participants
considered the presence of
at least one cause
explaining the presence of
the common­effect to be
sufficient grounds to grant
an exemplar a relatively
high category membership
rating in a common­effect
category. In contrast,

increase in (the logarithm of) categorization ratings for those exemplars in which
the common cause is present as a function of the number of effect features. In the
presence of the common cause each additional effect produced a constant increment
to log categorization ratings.
Finally, Figure 3 also indicates that the simple feature weights differed as a function
of causal schema. In the common­cause condition, the common­cause (f 1 ) carried
greater weight than the three effects (f 2 , f 3 , f 4 ). In contrast, in the common­effect
condition it was the common­effect (f 4 ) that had greater weight than the three
causes (f 1 , f 2 , f 3 ). That is, causal networks promote the importance of not only
specific feature combinations, but the importance of individual features as well.
Mode l F i t t i ng
To assess whether CMT accounts for the patterns of classification found in this
experiment, the causal models of Figure 1 were fitted to the category membership
ratings of each participant in the common­cause and common­effect conditions,
respectively. That is, the ratings were predicted from the equation,
Rating (X) = K ¥Likelihood (X; c, m, b)
where Likelihood (X; c, m, b) is the likelihood of exemplar X as a function of c, m,
and b. The likelihood equations for the common­cause and common­effect models
shown in Table 1 were used for common­cause and common­effect participants,
respectively. K is a scaling constant that brings the likelihood into the range 0­100.
For each participant, the values for parameters K, c, m, and b that minimized the
squared deviation between the predicted and observed ratings was computed. The
best fitting values for parameters K, c, m, and b averaged over participants were
846, .578, .214, and .437 in the common­cause condition, and 876, .522, .325, and
.280 in the common­effect condition. The predicted ratings for each exemplar are
presented in Table 1. The significantly positive estimate for m in both conditions
indicates that participants categorization performance was consistent with them
assuming the presence of a probabilistic causal mechanisms linking category
features. Ratings predicted by CMT did not differ from observed ratings according
to chi­square tests: c 2 (16)=3.0 for common cause, c 2 (16)=5.3 for common­effect.
To demonstrate that CMT predicts participants sensitivity to particular
combinations of features when categorizing, each participant s predicted ratings
were subjected to the same regressions that were performed on the observed ratings.
The resulting regression weights averaged over participants are presented in Figure
3 superimposed on the weights from the observed data. First, Figure 3 indicates that
CMT reproduces participants sensitivity to agreement between pairs of features
directly connected by causal relationships (f 12 , f 13 , f 14 in the common­cause
condition, and f 14 , f 24 , f 34 in the common­effect condition). That is, according to
both CMT and human participants, category membership ratings increase when
pairs of features confirm causal laws, and decrease when they violate those laws.
Second, Figure 3 indicates that CMT accounts for the interactions between the
effect features in the common­cause condition (f 12 , f 13 , f 23 ) and also for the higher­
order feature interactions in the common­effect condition (f 124 , f 134 , f 234 , f 1234 ),
indicating that that CMT is also sensitive to the asymmetries inherent in causal
relationships. The predictions of CMT superimposed on the observed data in Figure
4 confirm that CMT, like the human participants, requires only one cause feature to
explain the presence of a common effect (nonlinear increase in ratings in Figure
4b) whereas CMT predicts a linear increase in log ratings as one adds effect features
to a common cause (Figure 4a). Finally, CMT also accounts for the larger weight
given to the common cause and common­effect features (Figure 3).

D i scuss i on
The current results support CMT s claims that people have a representation of the
probabilistic causal mechanisms that link category features, and that they classify by
evaluating whether an object s combination of features was likely to have been
generated by those mechanisms. That is, people have models of the world that lead
them to expect a certain distribution of features in category members, and consider
exemplars good category members to the extent they manifest those expectations.
One way this effect manifested itself is in terms of the importance of preserved
correlations between features directly connected by causal relationships. An
alternative model that accounts for this particular result assumes that the feature
space is expanded to include configural cues encoding the confirmation or violation
of each causal relationship [6]. However, such a model treats causal links as
symmetric and does not consider interactions among links. As a result, it does not fit
the common effect data as well as CMT (Figure 4b), because it is unable to account
for categorizers sensitivity to the higher­order feature interactions that emerge as a
result of causal asymmetries in a complex network.
CMT diverges from traditional models of categorization by emphasizing the
knowledge people possess as opposed to the examples they observe. Indeed, the
current experiment differed from many categorization studies in not providing
examples of category members. As a result, CMT is applicable to the many real­
world categories about which people know far more than they have observed first
hand (e.g., scientific concepts). Of course, for many other categories people observe
category members, and the nature of the interactions between knowledge and
observations is an open question of considerable interest. Using the same materials
as in the current study, the effects of knowledge and observations have been
orthogonally manipulated with the finding that observations had little effect on
classification performance as compared to the theories [7]. Thus, theories may often
dominate categorization decisions even when observations are available.
