Abstract
This paper presents a novel approach to the unsupervised learning of syn­
tactic analyses of natural language text. Most previous work has focused
on maximizing likelihood according to generative PCFG models. In con­
trast, we employ a simpler probabilistic model over trees based directly
on constituent identity and linear context, and use an EM­like iterative
procedure to induce structure. This method produces much higher qual­
ity analyses, giving the best published results on the ATIS dataset.
1 Overview
To enable a wide range of subsequent tasks, human language sentences are standardly given
tree­structure analyses, wherein the nodes in a tree dominate contiguous spans of words
called constituents, as in figure 1(a). Constituents are the linguistically coherent units in
the sentence, and are usually labeled with a constituent category, such as noun phrase (NP)
or verb phrase (VP). An aim of grammar induction systems is to figure out, given just the
sentences in a corpus S, what tree structures correspond to them. In this sense, the grammar
induction problem is an incomplete data problem, where the complete data is the corpus
of trees T , but we only observe their yields S. This paper presents a new approach to this
problem, which gains leverage by directly making use of constituent contexts.
It is an open problem whether entirely unsupervised methods can produce linguistically
accurate parses of sentences. Due to the difficulty of this task, the vast majority of statis­
tical parsing work has focused on supervised learning approaches to parsing, where one
uses a treebank of fully parsed sentences to induce a model which parses unseen sentences
[7, 3]. But there are compelling motivations for unsupervised grammar induction. Building
supervised training data requires considerable resources, including time and linguistic ex­
pertise. Investigating unsupervised methods can shed light on linguistic phenomena which
are implicit within a supervised parser's supervisory information (e.g., unsupervised sys­
tems often have difficulty correctly attaching subjects to verbs above objects, whereas for
a supervised parser, this ordering is implicit in the supervisory information). Finally, while
the presented system makes no claims to modeling human language acquisition, results on
whether there is enough information in sentences to recover their structure are important
data for linguistic theory, where it has standardly been assumed that the information in the
data is deficient, and strong innate knowledge is required for language acquisition [4].

2 Previous Approaches
One aspect of grammar induction where there has already been substantial success is the
induction of parts­of­speech. Several different distributional clustering approaches have
resulted in relatively high­quality clusterings, though the clusters' resemblance to classical
parts­of­speech varies substantially [9, 15]. For the present work, we take the part­of­
speech induction problem as solved and work with sequences of parts­of­speech rather
than words. In some ways this makes the problem easier, such as by reducing sparsity,
but in other ways it complicates the task (even supervised parsers perform relatively poorly
with the actual words replaced by parts­of­speech).
Work attempting to induce tree structures has met with much less success. Most grammar
induction work assumes that trees are generated by a symbolic or probabilistic context­free
grammar (CFG or PCFG). These systems generally boil down to one of two types. Some
fix the structure of the grammar in advance [12], often with an aim to incorporate linguis­
tic constraints [2] or prior knowledge [13]. These systems typically then attempt to find
the grammar production parameters # which maximize the likelihood P(S|#) using the
inside­outside algorithm [1], which is an efficient (dynamic programming) instance of the
EM algorithm [8] for PCFGs. Other systems (which have generally been more success­
ful) incorporate a structural search as well, typically using a heuristic to propose candidate
grammar modifications which minimize the joint encoding of data and grammar using an
MDL criterion, which asserts that a good analysis is a short one, in that the joint encoding
of the grammar and the data is compact [6, 16, 18, 17]. These approaches can also be seen
as likelihood maximization where the objective function is the a posteriori likelihood of
the grammar given the data, and the description length provides a structural prior.
The ``compact grammar'' aspect of MDL is close to some traditional linguistic argumen­
tation which at times has argued for minimal grammars on grounds of analytical [10] or
cognitive [5] economy. However, the primary weakness of MDL­based systems does not
have to do with the objective function, but the search procedures they employ. Such sys­
tems end up growing structures greedily, in a bottom­up fashion. Therefore, their induction
quality is determined by how well they are able to heuristically predict what local interme­
diate structures will fit into good final global solutions.
A potential advantage of systems which fix the grammar and only perform parameter search
is that they do compare complete grammars against each other, and are therefore able to
detect which give rise to systematically compatible parses. However, although early work
showed that small, artificial CFGs could be induced with the EM algorithm [12], studies with
large natural language grammars have generally suggested that completely unsupervised
EM over PCFGs is ineffective for grammar acquisition. For instance, Carroll and Charniak
[2] describe experiments running the EM algorithm from random starting points, which
produced widely varying learned grammars, almost all of extremely poor quality. 1
1 We duplicated one of their experiments, which used grammars restricted to rules of the form
x # x y | y x , where there is one category x for each part­of­speech (such a restricted CFG is
isomorphic to a dependency grammar). We began reestimation from a grammar with uniform rewrite

It is well­known that EM is only locally optimal, and one might think that the locality
of the search procedure, not the objective function, is to blame. The truth is somewhere
in between. There are linguistic reasons to distrust an ML objective function. It encour­
ages the symbols and rules to align in ways which maximize the truth of the conditional
independence assumptions embodied by the PCFG. The symbols and rules of a natural lan­
guage grammar, on the other hand, represent syntactically and semantically coherent units,
for which a host of linguistic arguments have been made [14]. None of these have any­
thing to do with conditional independence; traditional linguistic constituency reflects only
grammatical regularities and possibilities for expansion. There are expected to be strong
connections across phrases (such as dependencies between verbs and their selected argu­
ments). It could be that ML over PCFGs and linguistic criteria align, but in practice they do
not always seem to. Experiments with both artificial [12] and real [13] data have shown that
starting from fixed, correct (or at least linguistically reasonable) structure, EM produces a
grammar which has higher log­likelihood than the linguistically determined grammar, but
lower parsing accuracy.
However, we additionally conjecture that EM over PCFGs fails to propagate contextual cues
efficiently. The reason we expect an algorithm to converge on a good PCFG is that there
seem to be coherent categories, like noun phrases, which occur in distinctive environments,
like between the beginning of the sentence and the verb phrase. In the inside­outside al­
gorithm, the product of inside and outside probabilities # j ( p, q)# j ( p, q) is the probability
of generating the sentence with a j constituent spanning words p through q: the outside
probability captures the environment, and the inside probability the coherent category. If
we had a good idea of what VPs and NPs looked like, then if a novel NP appeared in an
NP context, the outside probabilities should pressure the sequence to be parsed as an NP.
However, what happens early in the EM procedure, when we have no real idea about the
grammar parameters? With randomly­weighted, complete grammars over a symbol set X ,
we have observed that a frequent, short, noun phrase sequence often does get assigned to
some category x early on. However, since there is not a clear overall structure learned,
there is only very weak pressure for other NPs, even if they occur in the same positions,
to also be assigned to x , and the reestimation process goes astray. To enable this kind of
constituent­context pressure to be effective, we propose the model in the following section.
3 The Constituent­Context Model
We propose an alternate parametric family of models over trees which is better suited for
grammar induction. Broadly speaking, inducing trees like the one shown in figure 1(a) can
be broken into two tasks. One is deciding constituent identity: where the brackets should
be placed. The second is deciding what to label the constituents. These tasks are certainly
correlated and are usually solved jointly. However, the task of labeling chosen brackets is
essentially the same as the part­of­speech induction problem, and the solutions cited above
can be adapted to cluster constituents [6]. The task of deciding brackets, is the harder task.
For example, the sequence DT NN IN DT NN ([the man in the moon]) is virtually always a
noun phrase when it is a constituent, but it is only a constituent 66% of the time, because
the IN DT NN is often attached elsewhere ([we [sent a man] [to the moon]]). Figure 2(a)
probabilities. Figure 4 shows that the resulting grammar (DEP­PCFG) is not as bad as conventional
wisdom suggests. Carroll and Charniak are right to observe that the search spaces is riddled with
pronounced local maxima, and EM does not do nearly so well when randomly initialized. The need
for random seeding in using EM over PCFGs is two­fold. For some grammars, such as one over a set X
of non­terminals in which any x 1 # x 2 x 3 , x i # X is possible, it is needed to break symmetry. This
is not the case for dependency grammars, where symmetry is broken by the yields (e.g., a sentence
noun verb can only be covered by a noun or verb projection). The second reason is to start the search
from a random region of the space. But unless one does many random restarts, the uniform starting
condition is better than most extreme points in the space, and produces superior results.

Usually a Constituent
Rarely a Constituent

Figure 2: The most frequent examples of (a) different constituent labels and (b) constituents
and non­constituents, in the vector space of linear contexts, projected onto the first two
principal components. Clustering is effective for labeling, but not detecting constituents.
shows the 50 most frequent constituent sequences of three types, represented as points
in the vector space of their contexts (see below), projected onto their first two principal
components. The three clusters are relatively coherent, and it is not difficult to believe that
a clustering algorithm could detect them in the unprojected space. Figure 2(a), however,
shows 150 sequences which are parsed as constituents at least 50% of the time along with
150 which are not, again projected onto the first two components. This plot at least suggests
that the constituent/non­constituent classification is less amenable to direct clustering.
Thus, it is important that an induction system be able to detect constituents, either implicitly
or explicitly. A variety of methods of constituent detection have been proposed [11, 6],
usually based on information­theoretic properties of a sequence's distributional context.
However, here we rely entirely on the following two simple assumptions: (i) constituents
of a parse do not cross each other, and (ii) constituents occur in constituent contexts. The
first property is self­evident from the nature of the parse trees. The second is an extremely
weakened version of classic linguistic constituency tests [14].
Let # be a terminal sequence. Every occurrence of # will be in some linear context c(# ) =
x # y, where x and y are the adjacent terminals or sentence boundaries. Then we can
view any tree t over a sentence s as a collection of sequences and contexts, one of each for
every node in the tree, plus one for each inter­terminal empty span, as in figure 1(b). Good
trees will include nodes whose yields frequently occur as constituents and whose contexts
frequently surround constituents. Formally, we use a conditional exponential model of the
form:
P(t|s, #) =
exp( # (#,c)#t # # f # + # c f c )
# t :yield(t)=s exp( # (#,c)#t # # f # + # c f c )
We have one feature f # (t) for each sequence # whose value on a tree t is the number of
nodes in t with yield # , and one feature f c (t) for each context c representing the number of
times c is the context of the yield of some node in the tree. 2 No joint features over c and #
are used, and, unlike many other systems, there is no distinction between constituent types.
We model only the conditional likelihood of the trees, P(T |S, #), where # = {# # , # c }.
We then use an iterative EM­style procedure to find a local maximum P(T |S, #) of the
completed data (trees) T (P(T |S, #) = # t #T ,s=yield(t) P(t|s, #)). We initialize # such
that each # is zero and initialize T to any arbitrary set of trees. In alternating steps, we first
fix the parameters # and find the most probable single tree structure t # for each sentence
s according to P(t|s, #), using a simple dynamic program. For any # this produces the

set of parses T # which maximizes P(T |S, #). Since T # maximizes this quantity, if T # is
the former set of trees, P(T # |S, #) # P(T # |S, #). Second, we fix the trees and estimate
new parameters #. The task of finding the parameters # # which maximize P(T |S, #)
is simply the well­studied task of fitting our exponential model to maximize the condi­
tional likelihood of the fixed parses. Running, for example, a conjugate gradient (CG)
ascent on # will produce the desired # # . If # # is the former parameters, then we will
have P(T |S, # # ) # P(T |S, # # ). Therefore, each iteration will increase P(T |S, #) until
convergence. 3 Note that our parsing model is not a generative model, and this procedure,
though clearly related, is not exactly an instance of the EM algorithm. We merely guarantee
that the conditional likelihood of the data completions is increasing. Furthermore, unlike in
EM where each iteration increases the marginal likelihood of the fixed observed data, our
procedure increases the conditional likelihood of a changing complete data set, with the
completions changing at every iteration as we reparse.
Several implementation details were important in making the system work well. First, tie­
breaking was needed, most of all for the first round. Initially, the parameters are zero, and
all parses are therefore equally likely. To prevent bias, all ties were broken randomly.
Second, like so many statistical NLP tasks, smoothing was vital. There are features in our
model for arbitrarily long yields and most yield types occurred only a few times. The most
severe consequence of this sparsity was that initial parsing choices could easily become
frozen. If a # # for some yield # was either # 0 or # 0, which was usually the case for
rare yields, # would either be locked into always occurring or never occurring, respectively.
Not only did we want to push the # # values close to zero, we also wanted to account for
the fact that most spans are not constituents. 4 Therefore, we expect the distribution of the
# # to be skewed towards low values. 5 A greater amount of smoothing was needed for the
first few iterations, while much less was required in later iterations.
Finally, parameter estimation using a CG method was slow and difficult to smooth in
the desired manner, and so we used the smoothed relative frequency estimates # # =
count( f # )/(count(# ) + M) and # c = count( f c )/(count(c) + N). These estimates ensured
that the # values were between 0 and 1, and gave the desired bias towards non­constituency.
These estimates were fast and surprisingly effective, but do not guarantee non­decreasing
conditional likelihood (though the conditional likelihood was increasing in practice). 6
4 Results
In all experiments, we used hand­parsed sentences from the Penn Treebank. For training,
we took the approximately 7500 sentences in the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) section which
contained 10 words or fewer after the removal of punctuation. For testing, we evaluated the
system by comparing the system's parses for those same sentences against the supervised
parses in the treebank. We consider each parse as a set of constituent brackets, discarding
all trivial brackets. 7 We calculated the precision and recall of these brackets against the
treebank parses in the obvious way.
3 In practice, we stopped the system after 10 iterations, but final behavior was apparent after 4--8.
4 In a sentence of length n, there are (n + 1)(n + 2)/2 total (possibly size zero) spans, but only 3n
constituent spans: n - 1 of size # 2, n of size 1, and n + 1 empty spans.
5 Gaussian priors for the exponential model accomplish the former goal, but not the latter.
6 The relative frequency estimators had a somewhat subtle positive effect. Empty spans have no
effect on the model when using CG fitting, as all trees include the same empty spans. However,
including their counts improved performance substantially when using relative frequency estimators.
This is perhaps an indication that a generative version of this model would be advantageous.
7 We discarded both brackets of length one and brackets spanning the entire sentence, since all of
these are impossible to get incorrect, and hence ignored sentences of length # 2 during testing.

To situate the results of our system, figure 4(a) gives the values of several parsing strate­
gies. CCM is our constituent­context model. DEP­PCFG is a dependency PCFG model [2]
trained using the inside­outside algorithm. Figure 3 shows sample parses to give a feel for
the parses the systems produce. We also tested several baselines. RANDOM parses ran­
domly. This is an appropriate baseline for an unsupervised system. RBRANCH always
chooses the right­branching chain, while LBRANCH always chooses the left­branching
chain. RBRANCH is often used as a baseline for supervised systems, but exploits a system­
atic right­branching tendency of English. An unsupervised system has no a priori reason
to prefer right chains to left chains, and LBRANCH is well worse than RANDOM. A system
need not beat RBRANCH to claim partial success at grammar induction. Finally, we in­
clude an upper bound. All of the parsing strategies and systems mentioned here give fully
binary­branching structures. Treebank trees, however, need not be fully binary­branching,
and generally are not. As a result, there is an upper bound UBOUND on the precision and
F 1 scores achievable when structurally confined to binary trees.
Clearly, CCM is parsing much better than the RANDOM baseline and the DEP­PCFG induced
grammar. Significantly, it also out­performs RBRANCH in both precision and recall, and,
to our knowledge, it is the first unsupervised system to do so. To facilitate comparison
with other recent systems, figure 4(b) gives results where we trained as before but used
(all) the sentences from the distributionally different ATIS section of the treebank as a test
set. For this experiment, precision and recall were calculated using the EVALB system of
measuring precision and recall (as in [6, 17]) -- EVALB is a standard for parser evaluation,
but complex, and unsuited to evaluating unlabeled constituency. EMILE and ABL are lexical
systems described in [17]. The results for CDC­40, from [6], reflect training on much more
data (12M words). Our system is superior in terms of both precision and recall (and so F 1 ).
These figures are certainly not all that there is to say about an induced grammar; there are a
number of issues in how to interpret the results of an unsupervised system when comparing
with treebank parses. Errors come in several kinds. First are innocent sins of commis­
sion. Treebank trees are very flat; for example, there is no analysis of the inside of many
short noun phrases ([two hard drives] rather than [two [hard drives]]). Our system gives a

(usually correct) analysis of the insides of such NPs, for which it is penalized on precision
(though not recall or crossing brackets). Second are systematic alternate analyses. Our
system tends to form modal verb groups and often attaches verbs first to pronoun subjects
rather than to objects. As a result, many VPs are systematically incorrect, boosting cross­
ing bracket scores and impacting VP recall. Finally, the treebank's grammar is sometimes
an arbitrary, and even inconsistent standard for an unsupervised learner: alternate analy­
ses may be just as good. 8 Notwithstanding this, we believe that the treebank parses have
enough truth in them that parsing scores are a useful component of evaluation.
Ideally, we would like to inspect the quality of the grammar directly. Unfortunately, the
grammar acquired by our system is implicit in the learned feature weights. These are not
by themselves particularly interpretable, and not directly comparable to the grammars pro­
duced by other systems, except through their functional behavior. Any grammar which
parses a corpus will have a distribution over which sequences tend to be analyzed as con­
stituents. These distributions can give a good sense of what structures are and are not being
learned. Therefore, to supplement the parsing scores above, we examine these distributions.
Figure 5 shows the top scoring constituents by several orderings. These lists do not say
very much about how long, complex, recursive constructions are being analyzed by a given
system, but grammar induction systems are still at the level where major mistakes manifest
themselves in short, frequent sequences. CORRECT ranks sequences by how often they
occur as constituents in the treebank parses. DEP­PCFG and CCM are the same, but use
counts from the DEP­PCFG and CCM parses. As a baseline, FREQUENCY lists sequences by
how often they occur anywhere in the sentence yields. Note that the sequence IN DT (e.g.,
``of the'') is high on this list, and is a typical error of many early systems. Finally, ENTROPY
is the heuristic proposed in [11] which ranks by context entropy. It is better in practice than
FREQUENCY, but that isn't self­evident from this list. Clearly, the lists produced by the
CCM system are closer to correct than the others. They look much like a censored version
of the FREQUENCY list, where sequences which do not co­exist with higher­ranked ones
have been removed (e.g., IN DT often crosses DT NN). This observation may explain a good
part of the success of this method.
Another explanation for the surprising success of the system is that it exploits a deep fact
about language. Most long constituents have some short, frequent equivalent, or proform,
which occurs in similar contexts [14]. In the very common case where the proform is a
single word, it is guaranteed constituency, which will be transmitted to longer sequences
8 For example, transitive sentences are bracketed [subject [verb object]] (The president [executed
the law]) while nominalizations are bracketed [[possessive noun] complement] ([The president's ex­
ecution] of the law), an arbitrary inconsistency which is unlikely to be learned automatically.

via shared contexts (categories like PP which have infrequent proforms are not learned well
unless the empty sequence is in the model -- interestingly, the empty sequence appears to
act as the proform for PPs, possibly due to the highly optional nature of many PPs).
5 Conclusions
We have presented an alternate probability model over trees which is based on simple
assumptions about the nature of natural language structure. It is driven by the explicit
transfer between sequences and their contexts, and exploits both the proform phenomenon
and the fact that good constituents must tile in ways that systematically cover the corpus
sentences without crossing. The model clearly has limits. Lacking recursive features, it
essentially must analyze long, rare constructions using only contexts. However, despite, or
perhaps due to its simplicity, our model predicts bracketings very well, producing higher
quality structural analyses than previous methods which employ the PCFG model family.
