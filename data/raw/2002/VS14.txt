Feature Selection by Maximum Marginal Diversity

Nuno Vasconcelos Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering University of California, San Diego nuno@media.mit.edu

Abstract We address the question of feature selection in the context of visual recognition. It is shown that, besides efficient from a computational standpoint, the infomax principle is nearly optimal in the minimum Bayes error sense. The concept of marginal diversity is introduced, leading to a generic principle for feature selection (the principle of maximum marginal diversity) of extreme computational simplicity. The relationships between infomax and the maximization of marginal diversity are identified, uncovering the existence of a family of classification procedures for which near optimal (in the Bayes error sense) feature selection does not require combinatorial search. Examination of this family in light of recent studies on the statistics of natural images suggests that visual recognition problems are a subset of it.

1 Introduction It has long been recognized that feature extraction and feature selection are important problems in statistical learning. Given a classification or regression task in some observation

 

space space

(typically high-dimensional), the goal is to find the best transform into a feature ¡

(typically lower dimensional) where learning is easier (e.g. can be performed with ¢

less training data). While in the case of feature extraction there are few constraints on ¡ ,

for feature selection the transformation is constrained to be a projection, i.e. the components of a feature vector in are a subset of the components of the associated vector in . Both feature extraction and selection can be formulated as optimization problems where the goal is to find the transform that best satisfies a given criteria for "feature goodness". In this paper we concentrate on visual recognition, a subset of the classification problem for which various optimality criteria have been proposed throughout the years. In this context, the best feature spaces are those that maximize discrimination, i.e. the separation between the different image classes to recognize. However, classical discriminant criteria such as linear discriminant analysis make very specific assumptions regarding class densities, e.g. Gaussianity, that are unrealistic for most problems involving real data. Recently, various authors have advocated the use of information theoretic measures for feature extraction or selection [15, 3, 9, 11, 1]. These can be seen as instantiations of the the infomax principle

 

¢


of neural organization1 proposed by Linsker [7], which also encompasses information theoretic approaches for independent component analysis and blind-source separation [2]. In the classification context, infomax recommends the selection of the feature transform that maximizes the mutual information (MI) between features and class labels. While searching for the features that preserve the maximum amount of information about the class is, at an intuitive level, an appealing discriminant criteria, the infomax principle does not establish a direct connection to the ultimate measure of classification performance - the probability of error (PE). By noting that to maximize MI between features and class labels is the same as minimizing the entropy of labels given features, it is possible to establish a connection through Fano's inequality: that class-posterior entropy (CPE) is a lower bound on the PE [11, 4]. This connection is, however, weak in the sense that there is little insight on how tight the bound is, or if minimizing it has any relationship to minimizing PE. In fact, among all lower bounds on PE, it is not clear that CPE is the most relevant. An obvious alternative is the Bayes error (BE) which 1) is the tightest possible classifierindependent lower-bound, 2) is an intrinsic measure of the complexity of the discrimination problem and, 3) like CPE, depends on the feature transformation and class labels alone. Minimizing BE has been recently proposed for feature extraction in speech problems [10]. The main contribution of this paper is to show that the two strategies (infomax and minimum BE) are very closely related. In particular, it is shown that 1) CPE is a lower bound on BE and 2) this bound is tight, in the sense that the former is a good approximation to the latter. It follows that infomax solutions are near-optimal in the minimum BE sense. While for feature extraction both infomax and BE appear to be difficult to optimize directly, we show that infomax has clear computational advantages for feature selection, particularly in the context of the sequential procedures that are prevalent in the feature selection literature [6]. The analysis of some simple classification problems reveals that a quantity which plays an important role in infomax solutions is the marginal diversity: the average distance between each of the marginal class-conditional densities and their mean. This serves as inspiration to a generic principle for feature selection, the principle of maximum marginal diversity (MMD), that only requires marginal density estimates and can therefore be implemented with extreme computational simplicity. While heuristics that are close to the MMD principle have been proposed in the past, very little is known regarding their optimality. In this paper we summarize the main results of a theoretical characterization of the problems for which the principle is guaranteed to be optimal in the infomax sense (see [13] for further details). This characterization is interesting in two ways. First, it shows that there is a family of classification problems for which a near-optimal solution, in the BE sense, can be achieved with a computational procedure that does not involve combinatorial search. This is a major improvement, from a computational standpoint, to previous solutions for which some guarantee of optimality (branch and bound search) or near optimality (forward or backward search) is available [6]. Second, when combined with recent studies on the statistics of biologically plausible image transformations [8, 5], it suggests that in the context of visual recognition, MMD feature selection will lead to solutions that are optimal in the infomax sense. Given the computational simplicity of the MMD principle, this is quite significant. We present experimental evidence in support of these two properties of MMD. 2 Infomax vs minimum Bayes error In this section we show that, for classification problems, the infomax principle is closely related to the minimization of Bayes error. We start by defining these quantities.

1 Under the infomax principle, the optimal organization for a complex multi-layered perceptual

system is one where the information that reaches each layer is processed so that the maximum amount of information is preserved for subsequent layers.

that, at least when the number of classes is large, Fano's is really a lower bound on BE, not only on PE. Besides making this clear, Theorem 2 is a relevant contribution in two ways. First, since constants do not change the location of the bound's extrema, it shows that infomax minimizes a lower bound on BE. Second, unlike Fano's bound, it sheds considerable insight on the relationship between the extrema of the bound and those of the BE. In fact, it is clear from the derivation of the theorem that, the only reason why the righthand (RHS) and left-hand (LHS) sides of (4) differ is the application of (2). Figure 1

interesting properties. First, bound (2) is tight in the sense defined in the lemma. Second, the maximum of the LHS is co-located with that of the RHS. Finally, (like the RHS) the LHS is a concave function of  and increasing (decreasing) when the RHS is. Due to these properties, the LHS is a good approximation to the RHS and, consequently, the LHS of (4) a good approximation to its RHS. It follows that infomax solutions will, in general, be very similar to those that minimize the BE . This is illustrated by a simple example in Figure 2.

3 Feature selection For feature extraction, both infomax and minimum BE are complicated problems that can only be solved up to approximations [9, 11, 10]. It is therefore not clear which of the two strategies will be more useful in practice. We now show that the opposite holds for feature selection, where the minimization of CPE is significantly simpler than that of BE. We start by recalling that, because the possible number of feature subsets in a feature selection problem is combinatorial, feature selection techniques rely on sequential search methods [6]. These methods proceed in a sequence of steps, each adding a set of features to the current best subset, with the goal of optimizing a given cost function2. We denote the Theorem 3 Consider an   -class classification problem with observations drawn from a

These methods are called forward search techniques. There is also an alternative set of backward

search techniques, where features are successively removed from an initial set containing all features. We ignore the latter for simplicity, even though all that is said can be applied to them as well.

This principle has two attractive properties. First it is inherently discriminant, recommending the elimination of the dimensions along which the projections of the class densities are most similar. Second, it is straightforward to implement with the following algorithm.

The theorem states that the MMD and infomax solutions will be identical when the mutual information between features is not affected by knowledge of the class label. This is an interesting condition in light of various recent studies that have reported the observationof consistent patterns of dependence between the features of various biologically plausible image transformations [8, 5]. Even though the details of feature dependence will vary from one image class to the next, these studies suggest that the coarse structure of the patterns of dependence between such features follow universal statistical laws that hold for all types of images. The potential implications of this conjecture are quite significant. First it implies

that, in the context of visual processing, (8) will be approximately true and the MMD principle will consequently lead to solutions that are very close to optimal, in the minimum BE sense. Given the simplicity of MMD feature selection, this is quite remarkable. Second, it implies that when combined with such transformations, the marginal diversity is a close predictor for the CPE (and consequently the BE) achievable in a given feature space. This enables quantifying the goodness of the transformation without even having to build the classifier. See [13] for a more extensive discussion of these issues.

5 Experimental results In this section we present results showing that 1) MMD feature selection outperforms combinatorial search when (8) holds, and 2) in the context of visual recognition problems, marginal diversity is a good predictor of PE. We start by reporting results on a synthetic problem, introduced by Trunk to illustrate the curse of dimensionality [12], and used by Jain and Zongker (JZ) to evaluate various feature selection procedures [6]. It consists of teresting benchmark for feature selection because it has a clear optimal solution for the an automated procedure for testing the performance of feature selection algorithms across variations in dimensionality of the feature space and sample size. We repeated their experiments, simply replacing the cost function they used (Mahalanobis distance - MDist between the means) by the marginal diversity. Figure 4 a) presents the JZ score obtained with MMD as a function of the sample size. A comparison with Figure 5 of [6] shows that these results are superior to all those obtained by JZ, including the ones relying on branch and bound. This is remarkable, since branch and bound is guaranteed to find the optimal solution and the Mdist is inversely proportional to the PE for Gaussian classes. We believe that the superiority of MMD is due to the fact that it only requires estimates of the marginals, while the MDist requires estimates of joint densities and is therefore much more susceptible to the curse of dimensionality. Unfortunately, because in [6] all results are averaged over dimension, we have not been able to prove this conjecture yet. In any case, this problem is a good example of situations where, because (8) holds, MMD will find the optimal solution at a computational cost that is various orders of magnitude smaller than standard procedures based on combinatorial search (e.g. branch and bound). Figures 4 b) and c) show that, for problems involving commonly used image transformations, marginal diversity is indeed a good predictor of classification accuracy. The figures
