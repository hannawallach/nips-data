Nash Propagation for Loopy Graphical Games

Luis E. Ortiz Michael Kearns Department of Computer and Information Science University of Pennsylvania leortiz,mkearns @cis.upenn.edu Abstract We introduce NashProp, an iterative and local message-passing algorithm for computing Nash equilibria in multi-player games represented by arbitrary undirected graphs. We provide a formal analysis and experimental evidence demonstrating that NashProp performs well on large graphical games with many loops, often converging in just a dozen iterations on graphs with hundreds of nodes. NashProp generalizes the tree algorithm of (Kearns et al. 2001), and can be viewed as similar in spirit to belief propagation in probabilistic inference, and thus complements the recent work of (Vickrey and Koller 2002), who explored a junction tree approach. Thus, as for probabilistic inference, we have at least two promising general-purpose approaches to equilibria computation in graphs. 1 Introduction There has been considerable recent interest in representational and algorithmic issues arising in multi-player game theory. One example is the recent work on graphical games (Kearns et al. 2001) (abbreviated KLS in the sequel). Here a multi-player game is represented by an undirected graph. The interpretation is that while the global equilibria of the game depend on the actions of all players, individual payoffs for a player are determined solely by his own action and the actions of his immediate neighbors in the graph. Like graphical models in probabilistic inference, graphical games may provide an exponentially more succinct representation than the standard "tabular" or normal form of the game. Also as for probabilistic inference, the problem of computing equilibria on arbitrary graphs is intractable in general, and so it is of interest to identify both natural special topologies permitting fast Nash computations, and good heuristics for general graphs. KLS gave a dynamic programming algorithm for computing Nash equilibria in graphical games in which the underlying graph is a tree, and drew analogies to the polytree algorithm for probabilistic inference (Pearl 1988). A natural question following from this work is whether there are generalizations of the basic tree algorithm analogous to those for probabilistic inference. In probabilistic inference, there are two main approaches to generalizing the polytree algorithm. Roughly speaking, the first approach is to take an arbitrary graph and "turn it into a tree" via triangulation, and subsequently run the tree-based algorithm on the resulting junction tree (Lauritzen and Spiegelhalter 1988). This approach has the merit of being guaranteed to perform inference correctly, but the drawback of requiring the computation to be done on the junction tree. On highly loopy graphs, junction tree computations may require exponential time. The other broad approach is to simply run (an appropriate

 

¡


generalization of) the polytree algorithm on the original loopy graph. This method garnered considerable interest when it was discovered that it sometimes performed quite well empirically, and was closely connected to the problem of decoding in Turbo Codes. Belief propagation has the merit of each iteration being quite efficient, but the drawback of having no guarantee of convergence in general (though recent theoretical work has established convergence for certain special cases (Weiss 2000)). In recent work, (Vickrey and Koller 2002) proposed a number of heuristics for equilibria computation in graphical games, including a constraint satisfaction generalization of KLS that essentially provides a junction tree approach for arbitrary graphical games. They also gave promising experimental results for this heuristic on certain loopy graphs that result in manageable junction trees. In this work, we introduce the NashProp algorithm, a different KLS generalization which provides an approach analogous to loopy belief propagation for graphical games. Like belief propagation, NashProp is a local message-passing algorithm that operates directly on the original graph of the game, requiring no triangulation or moralization operations.

NashProp is a two-phase algorithm. In the first phase, nodes exchange messages in the form of two-dimensional tables. The table player sends to neighboring player in the graph indicates the values "believes" he can play given a setting of and the information he has received in tables from his other neighbors, a kind of conditional Nash equilibrium. In the second phase of NashProp, the players attempt to incrementally construct an equilibrium obeying constraints imposed by the tables computed in the first phase. Interestingly, we can provide rather strong theory for the first phase, proving that the tables must always converge, and result in a reduced search space that can never eliminate an equilibrium. When run using a discretization scheme introduced by KLS, the first phase of NashProp will actually converge in time polynomial in the size of the game representation. We also report on a number of controlled experiments with NashProp on loopy graphs, including some that would be difficult via the junction tree approach due to the graph topology. The results appear to be quite encouraging, thus growing the body of heuristics available for computing equilibria in compactly represented games. 2 Preliminaries

We are interested in heuristics that can exploit this succinctness computationally. 3 NashProp: Table-Passing Phase The table-passing phase of NashProp proceeds in a series of rounds.

Theorem 4 is important because it establishes that the table-passing phase provides us with an alternative -- and hopefully vastly reduced -- seach space for Nash equilibria. Rather than search for equilibria in the space of all mixed strategies, Theorem 4 asserts that we can limit our search to the space of that are consistent with the balanced limit tables tables is a locally stronger demand than merely asking for a player to be playing a best response to its neighborhood. Heuristics for searching this constrained space are the topic of Section 5.

might constitute

a significant reduction. The most obvious case is that in which many of the tables contain a large fraction of 0 entries, since every such entry eliminates all mixed strategies in which the corresponding pair of vertices plays the corresponding pair of values. As we shall see in the discussion of experimental results, such behavior seems to occur in many -- but certainly not all -- interesting cases. We shall also see that even when such reduction does not occur, the underlying graphical structure of the game may still yield significant computational benefits in the search for a consistent mixed strategy.

4 Approximate Tables Thus far we have assumed that the binary-valuedtables

each table will be  



P and thus exponential in , but the payoff matrices for the players §

are already exponential in , so our tables remain polynomial in the size of the graphical game representation. The crucial point established in KLS is that the required resolution is independent of the total number of players. It is easily verified that none of the key results establishing this fact (specifically, Lemmas 2, 3 and 4 of KLS) depend on the underlying graph being a tree, but hold for all graphical games. Precise analogues of all the results of the preceding section can thus be established for the discretized instantiation of the table-passing phase (details omitted). In particular, the tablepassing phase will now converge to finite balanced limit tables, and consistency with these tables characterizes -Nash equilibria. Furthermore, since every round prior to convergence must change at least one entry in one table, the table-passing phase must thus converge in §

f

¢

¡

¢

at most §   P rounds, which is again polynomial in the size of the game representation.

¡

Each round of the table-passing phase takes at most on the order of § @¨©   computational

steps in the worst case (though possibly considerably less), giving a total running time to the table-passing phase that scales polynomially with the size of the game. We note that the discretization of each player's space of mixed strategies allows one to formulate the problem of computing an approximate NE in a graphical game as a CSP(Vickrey and Koller 2002), and there is a precise connection between NashProp and constraint propagation algorithms for (generalized) arc consistency in constraint networks . 5 NashProp: Assignment-Passing Phase be considerably smaller than the set of all mixed strategies. We now describe heuristics for searching this space for a Nash equilibrium. For this it will be convenient to define, for (or by their allowed values in the aforementioned discretization scheme).

Let us begin by noting that the search space for a Nash equilibrium is immediately reduced to the cross-product of the projection sets by Theorem 4, so if the table-passing phase has resulted in many 0 values in the projections, even an exhaustive search across this (discretized) cross-product space may sometimes quickly yield a solution. However, we would obviously prefer a solution that exploits the local topology of the solution space given by the graph. At a high level, such a local search algorithm is straightforward:

Thus, the first vertex chosen assigns both itself and all of its neighbors, but afterwards vertices assign only (some of) their neighbors, and receive their own values from a neighbor. It is easily verified that if this process succeeds in assigning all vertices, the resulting mixed equilibrium in the discretized case). The difficulty, of course, is that the inductive step of the assignment-passing phase may fail due to cycles in the graph -- we may reach a node is not a best response to its complete neighborhood assignment. In this case, as with any structured local search phase, we have reached a failure point and must backtrack. The overall NashProp algorithm thus consists of the (always converging) table-passing phase followed by the backtracking local assignment-passing phase. NashProp directly generalizes the algorithm of KLS, and as such, on certain special topologies such as trees may provably yield efficient computation of equilibria. Here we have shown that NashProp enjoys several natural and desirable properties even on arbitrary graphs. We now turn to some experimental investigation of NashProp on graphs containing cycles. 6 Experimental Results We have implemented the NashProp algorithm (with distinct table-passing and assignmentpassing phases) as described, and run a series of controlled experiments on loopy graphs

Note that for this game, the table-passing phase constrains the search space tremendously -- so much so that the projection sets entirely determine the unique equilibrium, and the assignment-passing phase is superfluous. This is of course ideal behavior. The main results of our controlled experiments are summarized in Figure 2. One of our all 3000 runs described here.

Each row shows first the projection set, then the four outbound tables, for each of the 9 players in a 3 by 3 grid. For the reward functions, each player has a distinct preference for one of his two actions. For 15 of the 16 possible settings of his 4 neighbors, this preference is the same, but for the remaining setting it is reversed. It is easily verified that every player's payoff

primary interests is how the number of rounds in each of the two phases -- and therefore the overall running time -- scales with the size and complexity of the graph. More detail is provided in the caption, but we created graphs varying in size from 5 to 100 nodes with a number of different topologies: single cycles; single cycles to which a varying number of chords were added, which generates considerably more cycles in the graph; grids; and "ring of rings" (Vickrey and Koller 2002). We also experimented with local payoff matrices for some fixed number of the settings of its neighbors, each node has a strong preference for one of their actions, and in the remaining settings, a strong preference for the other. The (thus no simplification of the graph is possible). These classes of graphs seems to generate a nice variability in the relative speed of the table-passing and assignment-passing phases of NashProp, which is why we chose them. We now make a number of remarks regarding the NashProp experiments. First, and most basically, these preliminary results indicate that the algorithm performs well across a range of loopy topologies, including some (such as grids and cycles with many chords) that might pose computational challenges for junction tree approaches as the number of players becomes large. Excluding the small fraction of trials in which the assignment-passing phase failed to find a solution, even on grid and loopy chord graphs with 100 nodes, we find convergence of both the table and assignment-passing phases in less than a dozen rounds. We next note that there is considerable variation across topologies (and little within) in the amount of work done by the table-passing phase, both in terms of the expected number of rounds to convergence, and the fraction of 0 entries that have been computed at completion. For example, for cycles the amount of work in both senses is at its highest, while for grids with random rewards it is lowest. For grids and chordal cycles, decreasing the be accomplished by the table-passing phase. Intuitively, when rewards are entirely random and unbiased, nodes with large degrees will tend to rarely or never compute 0s in their

outbound tables -- there have too many neighbors whose combined setting can act as a witnesses for a 1 in an outbound table. However, as suggested by the theory, greater progress (and computation) in the tablepassing phase pays dividends in the assignment-passing phase, since the search space may have been dramatically reduced. For example, for chordal and grid graphs with biased rewards, the ordering of plots by convergence time is essentially reversed from the tablepassing to assignment-passing phases. This suggests that, when it occurs, the additional convergence time in the table-passing phase is worth the investment. However, we again note that even for the least useful table-passing phase (for grids with random rewards), the assignment-passing phase (which thus exploits the graph structure alone) still manages to find an equilibrium rapidly.
