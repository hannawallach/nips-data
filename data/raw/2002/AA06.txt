Abstract We consider the problem of multi-step ahead prediction in  time series analysis using the non-parametric Gaussian process model. -step ahead forecasting of a discrete-time non-linear dynamic system can be performed by doing repeated one-step ahead predictions. For a state-space model of the form ¡£¢¥¤§¦©¨¡¢ !"¡¢$#% , the prediction of ¡ at time per, we show how, using an analytical Gaussian approximation, we can formally incorporate the uncertainty about intermediate regressor values, thus updating the uncertainty on the current prediction.

1 Introduction One of the main objectives in time series analysis is forecasting and in many real life problems, one has to predict ahead in time, up to a certain time horizon (sometimes called lead time or prediction horizon). Furthermore, knowledge of the uncertainty of the prediction is important. Currently, the multiple-step ahead prediction task is achieved by either explic-


  itly training a direct model to predict steps ahead, or by doing repeated one-step ahead

predictions up to the desired horizon, which we call the iterative method. There are a number of reasons why the iterative method might be preferred to the `direct' one. Firstly, the direct method makes predictions for a fixed horizon only, making it com  putationally demanding if one is interested in different horizons. Furthermore, the larger , the more training data we need in order to achieve a good predictive performance, because method provides any -step ahead forecast, up to the desired horizon, as well as the joint probability distribution of the predicted points. In the Gaussian process modelling approach, one computes predictive distributions whose means serve as output estimates. Gaussian processes (GPs) for regression have historically been first introduced by O'Hagan [1] but started being a popular non-parametric modelling approach after the publication of [7]. In [10], it is shown that GPs can achieve a predictive performance comparable to (if not better than) other modelling approaches like neural   networks or local learning methods. We will show that for a -step ahead prediction which ignores the accumulating prediction variance, the model is not conservative enough, with unrealistically small  uncertainty attached to the forecast. An alternative solution is presented for iterative -step ahead prediction, with propagation of the prediction uncertainty. 2 Gaussian Process modelling We briefly recall some fundamentals of Gaussian processes. For a comprehensive introduction, please refer to [5], [11], or the more recent review [12]. 2.1 The GP prior model Formally, the random function, or stochastic process, ¦©¨¡  % is a Gaussian process, with ¦©¨¡  %   ! ¦©¨£  % , are seen as the components of a normally distributed random vector. If we further assume that the process is stationary: it has a constant mean and a covariance function only depending on the distance between the inputs . For any , we have

The role of the covariance function in the GP framework is similar to that of the kernels used in the Support Vector Machines community. This particular choice corresponds to a prior assumption that the underlying function ¦ is smooth and continuous. It accounts for a high correlation between the outputs of cases with nearby inputs.

1 This choice was motivated by the fact that, in [8], we were aiming at unified expressions for the

GPs and the Relevance Vector Machines models which employ such a kernel. More discussion about possible covariance functions can be found in [5].

Then, the"naive" iterative -step ahead prediction method works as follows: it predicts only one time step ahead, using the estimate of the output of the current prediction, as well as previous outputs (up to the lag P ), as the input to the prediction of the next time step, until the prediction steps ahead is made. That way, only the output estimates are used and the uncertainty induced by each successive prediction is not accounted for. Using the results derived in the previous section, we suggest to formally incorporate the uncertainty information about the intermediate regressor. That is, as we predict ahead in time, we now view the lagged outputs as random variables. In this framework, the input

4.1 Illustrative examples The first example is intended to provide a basis for comparing the approximate and exact solutions, within the Gaussian approximation of (5)), to the numerical solution (MonteCarlo sampling from the true distribution), when the uncertainty is propagated as we predict ahead in time. We use the second example, inspired from real-life problems, to show that iteratively predicting ahead in time without taking account of the uncertainties induced by each succesive prediction leads to inaccurate results, with unrealistically small error bars. We then assess the predictive performance of the different methods by computing the average absolute error (P  ), the average squared error (P ) and average minus log predictive density2 (P ), which measures the density of the actual true test output under the Gaussian

5 Conclusions We have presented a novel approach which allows us to use knowledge of the variance on inputs to Gaussian process models to achieve more realistic prediction variance in the case of noisy inputs. Iterating this approach allows us to use it as a method for efficient propagation of uncertainty in the multi-step ahead prediction task of non-linear time-series. In experiments on simulated dynamic systems, comparing our Gaussian approximation to Monte Carlo simulations, we found that the propagation method is comparable to Monte Carlo simulations, and that both approaches achieved more realistic error bars than a naive approach which ignores the uncertainty on current state. This method can help understanding the underlying dynamics of a system, as well as being useful, for instance, in a model predictive control framework where knowledge of the accuracy of the model predictions over the whole prediction horizon is required (see [6] for a model predictive control law based on Gaussian processes taking account of the prediction uncertainty). Note that this method is also useful in its own right in the case of noisy model inputs, assuming they have a Gaussian distribution.
