Abstract A unified, biophysically motivated Calcium-Dependent Learning model has been shown to account for various rate-based and spike time-dependent paradigms for inducing synaptic plasticity. Here, we investigate the properties of this model for a multi-synapse neuron that receives inputs with different spike-train statistics. In addition, we present a physiological form of metaplasticity, an activity-driven regulation mechanism, that is essential for the robustness of the model. A neuron thus implemented develops stable and selective receptive fields, given various input statistics Introduction

Calcium influx through NMDA receptors is essential for the induction of diverse forms of bidirectional synaptic plasticity, such as rate-based [1, 2] and spike timedependent plasticity (STDP) [3, 4]. Activation of NMDA receptors is also essential for functional plasticity in vivo [5]. An influential hypothesis holds that modest elevations of Ca above the basal line would induce LTD, while higher elevations would induce LTP[6, 7]. Based on these observations, a Unified Calcium Learning Model (UCM) has been proposed by Shouval et al. [8]. In this model, cellular activity is translated locally into the dendritic calcium concentrations Cai, through the voltage and time-dependence of the NMDA channels. The level of Cai determines the sign and magnitude of synaptic plasticity as determined through a function of local calcium (Cai)(see Methods). A further assumption is that the Back-Propagating


Action Potentials (BPAP) has a slow after-depolarizing tail. Implementation of this simple yet biophysical model has shown that it is sufficient to account for the outcome of different induction protocols of synaptic plasticity in a one-dimensional input space, as illustrated in Figure 1. In the pairing protocol, LTD occurs when LFS is paired with a small depolarization of the postsynaptic voltage while a larger depolarization yields LTP (Figure 1a), due to the voltage-dependence of the NMDA currents. In the rate-based protocol, low-frequency stimulation (LFS) gives rise to LTD while high-frequency stimulation (HFS) produces LTP (Figure 1b), due to the time-integration dynamics of the calcium transients. Finally, STDP gives LTD if a post-spike comes before a pre-spike within a time-window, and LTP if a post-spike comes after a pre-spike (Figure 1c); this is due to the coincidencedetector property of the NMDA receptors and the shape of the BPAP. In addition to these results, the model also predicts a previously uncharacterized pre-beforepost depressing regime and rate-dependence of the STDP curve. These findings have had preliminary experimental support [9, 3, 10], and as will be shown have consequences in the multi-dimensional environment that impact the results of this work.

plasticity-induction paradigms: implementation of (a) Pairing Protocol, (b) RateDependent Plasticity and (c) Spike-Time Dependent Plasticity. The Pairing Protocol was simulated with a fixed input rate of 3 Hz; STDP curve is shown for 1 Hz. Notice the new pre-before-post depression regime. In this study we investigate characteristics of the Calcium Control Hypothesis such as cooperativity and competition, and examine how they give rise to input selectivity. A neuron is called selective to a specific input pattern if it responds strongly to it and not to other patterns, which is equivalent to having a potentiated pathway to this pattern. Input selectivity is a general feature of neurons and underlies the formation of receptive fields and topographic mappings. We demonstrate that using the UCM alone, selectivity can arise, but only within a narrow range of parameters. Metaplasticity, the activity-dependent modulation of synaptic plasticity, is essential for robustness of the BCM model [11]. Furthermore, it has significant experimental support [12]. Here we propose a more biologically realistic implementation, compatible with the Calcium Control Hypothesis, which is based on experimental observations [13]. We find that it makes the UCM model more robust significantly expanding the range of parameters that result in selectivity. 2 Selectivity to Spike Train Correlations The development of neuronal selectivity, given any learning rule, depends on the statistical structures of the input environment. For spiking neurons, this structure


may include temporal, in addition to spatial statistics. One method of examining this feature is to generate input spike trains with different statistics across synapses. We use a simple scenario in which half of the synapses (group B) receive noisy Poisson spike trains with a mean rate rin , and the other half (group A), receive correlated spikes with the same rate rin . Input spikes in group A have an enhanced probability of arriving together (see Methods). One might expect that, by firing together, group A will gain control of the post-synaptic firing times and thus be potentiated, while group B will be depressed, in a manner similar to the STDP described by Song et al. [14]. In addition to the 100 excitatory neurons our neuron receives 20 inhibitory inputs. The results are shown in Figure 2. There exists a range of input frequencies (Figure 2a, left) at which segregation occurs between the correlated and uncorrelated groups. The cooperativity among the synapses in group A enhances its probability of generating a post-spike, which, through the BPAP causes strong depolarization. Since the NMDA channels are still open due to a recent pre-spike, this is likely to potentiates these synapses in a Hebbian-associative fashion. Group B will fire with equal probability before and after a post-spike which, given a sufficiently low NMDA receptor conductance, ensures that, on average, depression takes place. At the final state, the output spike train is irregular (Figure 2a, right) but its rate is stable (Figure 2a, center), indicating that the system had reached a fixed point with a balance between excitation and inhibition. a)

All the synapses are potentiated and depressed, respectively. These results, however, are sensitive to the simulation parameters. In fact, a slight change in the value of rin disrupts the segregation described previously (Figure 2b). For too high or too low values of rin , both channels are potentiated and depressed, respectively. This occurs because, unlike standard STDP models, the unified model exhibits frequency dependence in addition to spike-time dependence. This suggests that a stabilizing mechanism must be incorporated into the model.


3 Metaplasticity

In the BCM theory the threshold between LTD and LTP moves as a function of the history of postsynaptic activity [11]. This type of activity-dependent regulation of the properties of synaptic plasticity, or metaplasticity, was developed to ensure selectivity and stability. Experimental results have linked some forms of metaplasticity to the magnitude of the NMDA conductance; it is shown that as the cellular activity increases, NMDA conductance is down-regulated, and vice-versa [15, 16, 13, 17]. Under the Calcium Control Hypothesis, this sets the ground for a more physiological formulation of metaplasticity [18]. NMDA conductance is interpreted here as the total number (gm) of NMDA channels inserted in the membrane of the postsynaptic terminal. Consider a simple kinetic model in which additional channels can be inserted from an intracellular pool (gi) or removed and returned to the pool in an activity dependent manner. We assume

a fixed removal rate k- and a voltage sensitive insertion rate k+V k­

(Our results are not very sensitive to the details of the voltage dependence of insertion and removal rates)

This scheme leads us to a dynamic equation for gm, gm = - (k­ + k+V

k+V  gt, where gt is a normalizing factor, gt = gm + gi. The fixed point is:

gm =  gt k­/(k+V

(1)

If, in this model, cellular activity is translated into Ca, then gm can be loosely interpreted as the inverse of the BCM sliding threshold m [18]. Notice that in the original form of BCM, m is the time average of a non-linear function of the postsynaptic the activity level. In order to achieve competition, gm should not depend solely on local (synaptic) variables, but should rather detect changes of the global patterns of cellular activity. Here, the activity-signaling global variable is taken to be postsynaptic membrane potential. Implementation of metaplasticity widens significantly the range of input frequencies for which segregation between the weights of correlated and uncorrelated synapses is observed; this is shown in Figure 3a. At low spiking activity, the subthreshold depolarization levels prevent significant inward Ca currents. Under these conditions metaplasticity causes gm to grow. Persistent post-spike generation will lead gm and therefore Ca to decrease, hence scaling the synaptic weights downwards. Competition arises as the system searches for the balance between the selective positive feed-back of a standard Hebbian rule and the overall negative feed-back of a sliding threshold mechanism. However, consistent with the rate-based protocol described before, at too low and too high rin selectivity is disrupted, and the synapses will eventually all depress or potentiate, regardless of the statistical structures of the stimulus. Strengthening the correlation increases segregation (Figure 3b), demonstrating the effects of lateral cooperativity in potentiation. On the other hand, increasing the fraction of correlated inputs weakens the final weight of the correlated group (Figure 3c), suggesting that less potentiation is needed to control the output spike-timing. Notice that in the presence of metaplasticity, no upper saturation limit is required; the equilibrium of the fixed point is homeostatic, rather than imposed.

4 Selectivity to patterns of rate distribution

An alternative input environment is one in which the rates vary across the synapses and over time. This is a plausible representation for sensory neurons that are differentially excited. A straightforward method is to use rate distributions that are piecewise constant. We use a simple example in which the rate distributions are non-overlapping square patterns, as illustrated in Figure 4a (see Methods). The patterns are randomly presented to the neuron, being switched at regular epochs. Since the mean switching time is constant and much smaller than the time constant of learning, each synapse receives the same average input over time. However, we observe that, after training, the neuron spontaneously breaks the symmetry, as a subset of synapses becomes potentiated, while others are depressed (Figure 4b). It should be noticed that, because the choice of the training pattern at each epoch is random, the selected pattern is different at each run. Due to metaplasticity, these results are robust across different pattern amplitudes and pattern dimensions (not shown).

5 Discussion

Neurons in many cortical areas develop receptive fields that are selective to a small subset of stimulating inputs. This property has been shown to be experiencedependent [19, 20] and also dependent on NMDA receptors[5, 21]. It is likely, therefore, that receptive field formation relies on the same type of NMDA-dependent synaptic plasticity observed in vitro [1, 2, 4]. Previous work has shown that these in vitro rate and spike time-induced plasticity can be accounted for by the biologicallyinspired Unified Calcium Model. In this work, we have shown that the same model can lead to the experience-dependent development of neuronal selectivity. Metaplasticity adds robustness to the system and reinforces temporal competition between input patterns [11] , by controlled scaling of NMDAR currents. We have shown here that even in simple input environments there is segregation among the synaptic strengths, depending on the temporal input statistics of different channels. This is analogous to the explanation of ocular dominance that depends on temporal competition [22], and is likely to hold with more realistic assumptions. Because the UCM is responsive to input rates, in addition to spike-timing, we are able to achieve selectivity for rate-distribution patterns in spiking neurons that is comparable to the selectivity obtained in simplified, continuous-valued systems [23]. This result suggests that the coexistence and complementarity of rate- and spike time-dependent plasticities, previously demonstrated for a one-dimensional neuron [8], can also be extended to multi-dimensional input environments. We are currently investigating the formation of receptive fields in more realistic environments, such as natural stimuli and examining how the their statistical properties can be translated into a physiological mechanism for emergence of input selectivity. 6 Methods We simulate a single neuron with 20 non-plastic inhibitory synapses and 100 excitatory synapses undergoing the Calcium-Dependent learning rule: w i = (Cai) ((Cai) - w) , (2) where wi is the synaptic weight of the synapse i, i = 1, ..., 100,  is a linear calcium-dependent learning rate  = 10-3Ca and  is a difference of sigmoids:  = and (1, 1, 2, 2) = (0.25, 60, 0.4, 20). Here, we use  = 0. The initial condi(Ca, 1, 1)-0.5(Ca, 2, 2), with (x, a, b) := exp(b(x-a)) [1 + exp(b(x - a))]-1 tion for all weights is 0.5; additionally, wi is constrained within hard boundaries: wi  [0, 1] for the cases where no metaplasticity is used. The NMDA-mediated calcium concentration varies as:

dCai dt = I - Cai , Ca (3)

where I is the NMDA current and Ca = 20 ms is the passive decay time constant [24]. I depends on the association between pre-spike times and postsynaptic depolarization level, described by I = gmf(t, tpre)H(V ) [7]. At the non-metaplastic value of 1. 70% of this value decays with time constant f = 50 ms, the remaining cases, we use gm = 2.53 × 10-4µM/(mV.ms). Upon a pre-spike, f reaches its peak

with the reversal potential for calcium Vrev = 130 mV. The dynamics of the membrane potential is simulated with the standard Integrateand-Fire model:

where m =20 ms, (Vrest, Vex, Vin) = (-65, 0, 65) mV.( If a pre-spike arrives at the Gex and Gin decay exponentially with time constant  = 5 ms. For excitatory and inhibitory synapses, (gi, gmax) = (wi, 0.09) and (1, 0.3) respectively. If Vm(t) reaches firing threshold of -55 mV, a post-spike is generated and the BPAP is updated to remaining decays slowly (s = 35 ms) [25]. The voltage at the synaptic site is thus

its peak value of 60 mV. 75% of this value decays rapidly (f B = 3 ms) and the

given by the sum V = Vm+BPAP. To implement input correlations, we adopt the method used by [26]. Let the number of correlated input be N. For a pre-assigned correlation parameter c, N0 Poisson distributed among the N synapses. It is clear that each resulting spike-train still (1 - N), and, at each time step, randomly has the same Poisson distribution, but with a probability of spiking together with other synapses. For simulations involving different rates, the 100 synapses were first divided into 4 channels of 25 synapses. Time epochs were generated according to an exponential distribution of mean c = 500 ms. At each epoch, one of the channels was randomly chosen and assigned a mean rate r, while others receive spike-trains with mean rate r < r. gt = -0.0184 and  = 4. All of the simulations use time steps of dt = 1 ms. For metaplasticity in Equation 1, we use the parameters: k­/(k+) = 9.1739 × 107, Acknowledgments This work is partly funded by the Brown Brain Science Program BurroughsWellcome Fund fellowship program.
