Abstract We consider Bayesian mixture approaches, where a predictor is constructed by forming a weighted average of hypotheses from some space of functions. While such procedures are known to lead to optimal predictors in several cases, where sufficiently accurate prior information is available, it has not been clear how they perform when some of the prior assumptions are violated. In this paper we establish data-dependent bounds for such procedures, extending previous randomized approaches such as the Gibbs algorithm to a fully Bayesian setting. The finite-sample guarantees established in this work enable the utilization of Bayesian mixture approaches in agnostic settings, where the usual assumptions of the Bayesian paradigm fail to hold. Moreover, the bounds derived can be directly applied to non-Bayesian mixture approaches such as Bagging and Boosting. Introduction and Motivation

1

The standard approach to Computational Learning Theory is usually formulated within the so-called frequentist approach to Statistics. Within this paradigm one is interested in constructing an estimator, based on a finite sample, which possesses a small loss (generalization error). While many algorithms have been constructed and analyzed within this context, it is not clear how these approaches relate to standard optimality criteria within the frequentist framework. Two classic optimality criteria within the latter approach are the minimax and admissibility criteria, which characterize optimality of estimators in a rigorous and precise fashion [9]. Except in some special cases [12], it is not known whether any of the approaches used within the Learning community lead to optimality in either of the above senses of the word. On the other hand, it is known that under certain regularity conditions, Bayesian estimators lead to either minimax or admissible estimators, and thus to well-defined optimality in the classical (frequentist) sense. In fact, it can be shown that Bayes estimators are essentially the only estimators which can achieve optimality in the above senses [9]. This optimality feature provides strong motivation for the study of Bayesian approaches in a frequentist setting. While Bayesian approaches have been widely studied, there have not been generally


applicable bounds in the frequentist framework. Recently, several approaches have attempted to address this problem. In this paper we establish finite sample datadependent bounds for Bayesian mixture methods, which together with the above optimality properties suggest that these approaches should become more widely used. Consider the problem of supervised learning where we attempt to construct an estimator based on a finite sample of pairs of examples S = {(x1,y1),...,(xn,yn)}, each drawn independently according to an unknown distribution µ(x,y). Let A be a learning algorithm which, based on the sample S, constructs a hypothesis (estimator) h from some set of hypotheses H. Denoting by (y,h(x)) the instantaneous loss of the hypothesis h, we wish to assess the true loss L(h) = Eµ (y,h(x)) where the expectation is taken with respect to µ. In particular, the objective is to provide data-dependent bounds of the following form. For any h  H and   (0,1), with probability at least 1 - , L(h)  (h,S) + (h,S,), (1) where (h,S) is some empirical assessment of the true loss, and (h,S,) is a complexity term. For example, in the classic Vapnik-Chervonenkis framework, (h,S) dimension of H but is independent of both the hypothesis h and the sample S. By algorithm and data-dependent bounds we mean bounds where the complexity term depends on both the hypothesis (chosen by the algorithm A) and the sample S. 2 A Decision Theoretic Bayesian Framework Consider a decision theoretic setting where we define the sample dependent loss of an algorithm A by R(µ,A,S) = Eµ (y,A(x,S)). Let µ be the optimal predictor for y, namely the function minimizing Eµ{ (y,(x))} over . It is clear that the best algorithm A (Bayes algorithm) is the one that always return µ, assuming µ is known. We are interested in the expected loss of an algorithm averaged over samples S: R(µ,A) = ESR(µ,A,S) = R(µ,A,S)dµ(S), where the expectation is taken with respect to the sample S drawn i.i.d. from the probability measure µ. If we consider a family of measures µ, which possesses some underlying prior distribution (µ), then we can construct the averaged risk function with respect to the prior as, r(,A) = ER(µ,A) = dµ(S)d(µ) R(µ,A,S)d(µ|S),

is the empirical error (1/n) n i=1 (yi,h(xi)) and (h,S,) depends on the VC-

where d(µ|S) =

dµ(S)d(µ)

dµ(S)d(µ) µ

is the posterior distribution on the µ family, which

induces a posterior distribution on the sample space as S = E( µ|S) µ. An algorithm

minimizing the Bayes risk r(,A) is referred to as a Bayes algorithm. In fact, for a given prior, and a given sample S, the optimal algorithm should return the Bayes optimal predictor with respect to the posterior measure S. For many important practical problems, the optimal Bayes predictor is a linear functional of the underlying probability measure. For example, if the loss function is quadratic, namely (y,A(x)) = (y-A(x))2, then the optimal Bayes predictor µ(x) is the conditional mean of y, namely Eµ[y|x]. For binary classification problems, we can let the predictor be the conditional probability µ(x) = µ(y = 1|x) (the optimal classification decision rule then corresponds to a test of whether µ(x) > 0.5), which


is also a linear functional of µ. Clearly if the Bayes predictor is a linear functional of the probability measure, then the optimal Bayes algorithm with respect to the prior  is given by AB(x,S) = µ(x)d(µ|S) = . (2) In this case, an optimal Bayesian algorithm can be regarded as the predictor constructed by averaging over all predictors with respect to a data-dependent posterior (µ|S). We refer to such methods as Bayesian mixture methods. While the Bayes estimator AB(x,S) is optimal with respect to the Bayes risk r(,A), it can be shown, that under appropriate conditions (and an appropriate prior) it is also a minimax and admissible estimator [9]. In general, µ is unknown. Rather we may have some prior information about possible models for µ. In view of (2) we consider a hypothesis space H, and an algorithm based on a mixture of hypotheses h  H. This should be contrasted with classical approaches where an algorithm selects a single hypothesis h form H. For simplicity, we consider a countable hypothesis space H = {h1,h2,...}; the general case will be deferred to the full paper. Let q = {qj}j=1 be a probability

complex that any single hypothesis hj. For example, if hj(x) are non-polynomial ridge functions, the composite predictor f corresponds to a two-layer neural network with universal approximation power. We denote by Q the probability distribution A main feature of this work is the establishment of data-dependent bounds on L(Eh h), the loss of the Bayes mixture algorithm. There has been a flurry of

recent activity concerning data-dependent bounds (a non-exhaustive list includes [2, 3, 5, 11, 13]). In a related vein, McAllester [7] provided a data-dependent bound for the so-called Gibbs algorithm, which selects a hypothesis at random from H based on the posterior distribution (h|S). Essentially, this result provides a bound on the average error Eh L(h) rather than a bound on the error of the averaged

hypothesis. Later, Langford et al. [6] extended this result to a mixture of classifiers using a margin-based loss function. A more general result can also be obtained using the covering number approach described in [14]. Finally, Herbrich and Graepel [4] showed that under certain conditions the bounds for the Gibbs classifier can be extended to a Bayesian mixture classifier. However, their bound contained an explicit dependence on the dimension (see Thm. 3 in [4]). Although the approach pioneered by McAllester came to be known as PAC-Bayes, this term is somewhat misleading since an optimal Bayesian method (in the decision theoretic framework outline above) does not average over loss functions but rather over hypotheses. In this regard, the learning behavior of a true Bayesian method is not addressed in the PAC-Bayes analysis. In this paper, we would like to narrow the discrepancy by analyzing Bayesian mixture methods, where we consider a predictor that is the average of a family of predictors with respect to a data-dependent posterior distribution. Bayesian mixtures can often be regarded as a good approximation to a true optimal Bayesian method. In fact, we have shown above that they are equivalent for many important practical problems. Therefore the main contribution of the present work is the extension of the above mentioned results in PAC-Bayes analysis to a rather unified setting for Bayesian mixture methods, where different regularization criteria may be incorporated, and their effect on the performance easily assessed. Furthermore, it is also essential that


the bounds obtained are dimension-independent, since otherwise they yield useless results when applied to kernel-based methods, which often map the input space into a space of very high dimensionality. Similar results can also be obtained using the covering number analysis in [14]. However the approach presented in the current paper, which relies on the direct computation of the Rademacher complexity, is more direct and gives better bounds. The analysis is also easier to generalize than the corresponding covering number approach. Moreover, our analysis applies directly to other non-Bayesian mixture approaches such as Bagging and Boosting. Before moving to the derivation of our bounds, we formalize our approach. Consider a countable hypothesis space H = {hj} , and a probability distribution {qj} over within the Bayesian mixture framework uses the sample S to select a distribution Q over H and then constructs a mixture hypothesis fq(x) = q h(x). In order to constrain the class of mixtures used in constructing the mixture q h we impose constraints on the mixture vector q. Let g(q) be a non-negative convex function of q and define for any positive A, A = {q  S : g(q)  A} ; FA = fq : fq(x) = q h(x) : q  A , (3) where S denotes the probability simplex. In subsequent sections we will consider different choices for g(q), which essentially acts as a regularization term. Finally, for any mixture q h we define the loss by L(q h) = Eµ (y,(q h)(x)) and the

A Mixture Algorithm with an Entropic Constraint

In this section we consider an entropic constraint, which penalizes weights deviating significantly from some prior probability distribution  = {j} , which may

incorporate our prior information about he problem. The weights q themselves are chosen by the algorithm based on the data. In particular, in this section we set g(q) to be the Kullback-Leibler divergence of q from , g(q) = D(q ) ; D(q ) = qj log(qj/j).

The expectation of Rn(F) with respect to S will be denoted by Rn(F). We note ^ that Rn(F) is concentrated around its mean value Rn(F) (e.g., Thm. 8 in [1]). We ^ quote a slightly adapted result from [5]. Theorem 1 (Adapted from Theorem 1 in [5]) Let {x1,x2,...,xn}  X be a sequence of points generated independently at random according to a probability distribution P, and let F be a class of measurable functions from X to R. Furthermore, let  be a non-negative Lipschitz function with Lipschitz constant , such that f is uniformly bounded by a constant M. Then for all f  F with probability at least 1 -

An immediate consequence of Theorem 1 is the following. Lemma 3.1 Let the loss function be bounded by M, and assume that it is Lipschitz with constant . Then for all q  A with probability at least 1 -

Next, we bound the empirical Rademacher average of FA using g(q) = D(q ). Lemma 3.2 The empirical Rademacher complexity of FA is upper bounded as follows:

Minimizing the r.h.s. with respect to , we obtain the desired result. Combining Lemmas 3.1 and 3.2 yields our basic bound, where  and M are defined in Lemma 3.1. Theorem 2 Let S = {(x1,y1),..., (xn,yn)} be a sample of i.i.d. points each drawn according to a distribution µ(x,y). Let H be a countable hypothesis class, and set FA to be the class defined in (3) with g(q) = D(q ). Set H =

Note that if hj are uniformly bounded, hj  c, then H  c. Theorem 2 holds for a fixed value of A. Using the so-called multiple testing Lemma (e.g. [11]) we obtain: Corollary 3.1 Let the assumptions of Theorem 2 hold, and let {Ai,pi} be a set of

positive numbers such that at least 1 - , i pi = 1. Then for all Ai and q  Ai with probability

L(q h)  L(q h) + 4H ^ 2Ai n + M log(1/pi) 2n .

Note that the only distinction with Theorem 2 is the extra factor of logpi which is the price paid for the uniformity of the bound. Finally, we present a data-dependent bound of the form (1). Theorem 3 Let the assumptions of Theorem 2 hold. Then for all q  S with probability at least 1 - ,

full paper, yield the desired result. The results of Theorem 3 can be compared to those derived by McAllester [8] for the randomized Gibbs procedure. In the latter case, the first term on the r.h.s. is Eh L(h), namely the average empirical error of the base classifiers h. In our case the corresponding term is L(Eh h), namely the empirical error of the average hypothesis. Since Eh h is potentially much more complex than any single h  H,

we expect that the empirical term in (4) is much smaller than the corresponding term in [8]. Moreover, the complexity term we obtain is in fact tighter than the corresponding term in [8] by a logarithmic factor in n (although the logarithmic factor in [8] could probably be eliminated). We thus expect that Bayesian mixture approach advocated here leads to better performance guarantees. Finally, we comment that Theorem 3 can be used to obtain so-called oracle inequalities. In particular, let q be the optimal distribution minimizing L(q h), which can only be computed if the underlying distribution µ(x,y) is known. Consider an algorithm which, based only on the data, selects a distribution q by minimizing ^ the r.h.s. of (4), with the implicit constants appropriately specified. Then, using standard approaches (e.g. [2]) we can obtain a bound on L(q h) - L(q h). For ^ lack of space, we defer the derivation of the precise bound to the full paper. 4 General Data-Dependent Bounds for Bayesian Mixtures The Kullback-Leibler divergence is but one way to incorporate prior information. In this section we extend the results to general convex regularization functions

In the remainder of the section we focus on the the case of regularization based on the Lp norm. Consider p and q such that 1/q + 1/p = 1, p  (1,), and let p = max(p,2) and q = min(q,2). Note that if p  2 then q  2,q = p = 2 and if p > 2

then q < 2,q = q,p = p. Consider p-norm regularization g(q) =

from some underlying hypothesis class using data-dependent weights. Such weighted averaging approaches have been used extensively within the Bayesian framework, as well as in more recent approaches such as Bagging and Boosting. While Bayesian methods are known, under favorable conditions, to lead to optimal estimators in a frequentist setting, their performance in agnostic settings, where no reliable assumptions can be made concerning the data generating mechanism, has not been well understood. Our data-dependent bounds allow the utilization of Bayesian mixture models in general settings, while at the same time taking advantage of the benefits of the Bayesian approach in terms of incorporation of prior knowledge. The bounds established, being independent of the cardinality of the underlying hypothesis space, can be directly applied to kernel based methods.
