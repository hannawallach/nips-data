Abstract
We analyze the bit error probability of multiuser demodulators for direct­
sequence binary phase­shift­keying (DS/BPSK) CDMA channel with ad­
ditive gaussian noise. The problem of multiuser demodulation is cast
into the finite­temperature decoding problem, and replica analysis is ap­
plied to evaluate the performance of the resulting MPM (Marginal Pos­
terior Mode) demodulators, which include the optimal demodulator and
the MAP demodulator as special cases. An approximate implementa­
tion of demodulators is proposed using analog­valued Hopfield model
as a naive mean­field approximation to the MPM demodulators, and its
performance is also evaluated by the replica analysis. Results of the per­
formance evaluation shows effectiveness of the optimal demodulator and
the mean­field demodulator compared with the conventional one, espe­
cially in the cases of small information bit rate and low noise level.
1 Introduction
The CDMA (Code­Division­Multiple­Access) technique [1] is important as a fundamental
technology of digital communications systems, such as cellular phones. The important ap­
plications include realization of spread­spectrum multipoint­to­point communications sys­
tems, in which multiple users share the same communication channel. In the multipoint­to­
point system, each user modulates his/her own information bit sequence using a spreading
code sequence before transmitting it, and the receiver uses the same spreading code se­
quence for demodulation to obtain the original information bit sequence. Different users
use different spreading code sequences so that the demodulation procedure randomizes
and thus suppresses multiple access interference effects of transmitted signal sequences
sent from different users.
The direct­sequence binary phase­shift­keying (DS/BPSK) [1] is the basic method among
various methods realizing CDMA, and a lot of studies have been done on it. Use of
Hopfield­type recurrent neural network has been proposed as an implementation of a mul­
tiuser demodulator [2]. In this paper, we analyze the bit error probability of the neural
multiuser demodulator applied to demodulation of DS/BPSK CDMA channel.

We assume that a single Gaussian channel is shared by N users, each of which wishes
to transmit his/her own information bit sequence. We also take a simplifying assumption,
that all the users are completely synchronized with each other, with respect not only to the
chip timing but also to the information bit timing. We focus on any of the time intervals
corresponding to the duration of one information bit. Let # i 2 {-1, 1} be the information
bit to be transmitted by user i (i = 1, . . . , N ) during the time interval, and P be the number
of the spreading code chips (clocks) per information bit. For simplicity, the spreading code
sequences for the users are assumed to be random bit sequences {# t
i ; t = 1, . . . , P}, where
# t
i 's are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) binary random variables following
Prob[# t
i = ±1] = 1/2.
User i modulates the information bit # i by the spreading code sequence and transmits the
modulated sequence {# i # t
i ; t = 1, . . . , P} (with carrier modulation, in actual situations).
Assuming that power control [3] is done perfectly so that every transmitted sequences ar­
rive at the receiver with the same intensity, the received signal sequence (after baseband
demodulation) is {y t
; t = 1, . . . , P}, with
y t
=
N
X i =1
# t
i # i + # t , (1)
where # t
 N(0, # 2
s ) is i.i.d. gaussian noise. This system is illustrated in Fig. 1.
At the receiver side, one has to estimate the information bits {# i } based on the knowledge of
the received signal {y t
} and the spreading code sequences {# t
i } for the users. The demodu­
lator refers to the system which does this task. Accuracy of the estimation depends on what
demodulator one uses. Some demodulators are introduced in Sect. 3, and analytical results
for their performance is derived in Sect. 4.

3 Demodulators
3.1 Conventional demodulator
The conventional demodulator (CD) [1--3] estimates the information bit # i using the spread­
ing code sequence {# t
i ; t = 1, . . . , P} for the user i , by
“
# (CD)
i = sgn(h i ), h i  1
N
P
X t=1
# t
i y t . (2)
We can rewrite h i as
h i = P
N # i + 1
N
P
X t =1
N
X k
6 =i
# t
i # t
k # k + 1
N
P
X t =1
# t
i # t . (3)
The second and third terms of the right­hand side represent the effects of multiple ac­
cess interference and noise, respectively. CD would give the correct information bit in the
single­user (N = 1), and no noise (# t
 0) case, but estimation may contain some errors
in the multiple­user and/or noisy cases.
3.2 MAP demodulator
The accuracy of the estimation would be significantly improved if the demodulator knows
the spreading code sequences for all N users and makes full use of them by simultane­
ously estimating the information bits for all the users (the multiuser demodulator). This
is the case, for example, for a base station receiving signals from many users. A common
approach to the multiuser demodulation is to use the MAP decoding, which estimates the
information bits {s i = “
# i } by maximizing the posterior probability p({# i }|{y t
}). We call
this kind of multiuser demodulator the MAP demodulator 1 .
When we assume uniform prior for the information bits, the posterior probability is explic­
itly given by
p(s|{y t
}) = Z -1 exp -# s H(s)  , (4)
where
H(s)  1
2 s T W s - h T s, (5)
# s  N/# 2
s , s  (s i ), h  (h i ), and W  (w i j ) is the sample covariance of the spreading
code sequences,
w i j = 1

The problem of MAP demodulation thus reduces to the following minimization problem:

3.3 MPM demodulator
Although the MAP demodulator is sometimes referred to as ``optimal,'' actually it is not so
in terms of the common measure of performance, i.e., the bit error probability P b , which is

likelihood (ML) demodulator'' in the literature.

P b = 1 - M
2 . (8)
The `MPM (Marginal Posterior Mode [4]) demodulator,' with the inverse temperature #, is
defined as follows:
“
# (MPM)
i = sgn(hs i i # ), (9)
where h·i # refers to the average with respect to the distribution
p # (s) = Z(#) -1 exp -#H(s)  . (10)
Then, we can show that the MPM demodulator with # = # s is the optimal one minimizing
the bit error probability P b . It is a direct consequence of general argument on optimal
decoders [5]. Note that the MAP demodulator corresponds to the MPM demodulator in the
# ! +1 limit (the zero­temperature demodulator).
4 Analysis
4.1 Conventional demodulator
In the cases where we can assume that N and P are both large while #  P/N = O(1),
evaluation of the overlap M , and therefore the bit error probability P b , for those demodu­
lators are possible. For CD, simple application of the central limit theorem yields
M = erf r #
2(1 + 1/# s )
 , (11)
where
erf(x)  2
p #

is the error function.
4.2 MPM demodulator
For the MPM demodulator with inverse temperature #, we have used the replica analysis
to evaluate the bit error probability P b . Assuming that N and P are both large while # 
P/N = O(1), and that the macroscopic properties of the demodulator are self­averaging
with respect to the randomness of the information bits, of the spreading codes, and of the
noise, we evaluate the quenched average of the free energy hhlog Zii in the thermodynamic
limit N !1, where hh·ii denotes averaging over the information bits and the noise.
Evaluation of the overlap M (within replica­symmetric (RS) ansatz) requires solving
saddle­point problem for scalar variables {m, q, E, F}. The saddle­point equations are
m = Z Dz tanh( p Fz + E), q = Z Dz tanh 2 (
p Fz + E)
E = ##
1 + #(1 - q) , F = ## 2
[1 + #(1 - q)] 2 h 1 - 2m + q +
1
# s
i (13)
where Dz  (1/
p 2#)e -z 2 /2 dz is the gaussian measure. The overlap M is then given by
M = Z Dz sgn( p Fz + E), (14)
from which P b is evaluated via (8). This is the first main result of this paper.

4.3 MAP demodulator: Zero­temperature limit
Taking the zero­temperature limit # ! +1 of the result for the MPM demodulator yields
the result for the MAP demodulator. Assuming that q ! 1 as # ! +1, while #(1 - q)
remains finite in this limit, the saddle­point equations reduce to
M = m = erf r #
2(2 - 2m + 1/# s )
 . (15)
It is found numerically, however, that the assumption q ! 1 is not valid for small #, so
that we have to solve the original saddle­point equations in such cases.
4.4 Optimal demodulator: The case # = # s
Letting # = # s in the result for the MPM demodulator gives the optimal demodulator
minimizing the bit error probability. In this case, it can be shown that m = q and E = F
hold for the solutions of the saddle­point equations (13).
4.5 Demodulator using naive mean­field approximation
Since solving the MAP or MPM demodulation problem is in general NP complete, we have
to consider approximate implementations of those demodulators which are sub­optimal. A
straightforward choice is the mean­field approximation (MFA) demodulator, which uses
the analog­valued Hopfield model as the naive mean­field approximation to the finite­
temperature demodulation problem 2 . The solution {m i } of the mean­field equations
m i = tanh h # - X j
w i j m j + h i  i (16)
gives an approximation to {hs i i # }, from which we have the mean­field approximation to
the MPM estimates, as
“
# (MFA)
i = sgn(m i ). (17)
The macroscopic properties of the MFA demodulator can be derived by the replica analysis
as well, along the line proposed by Bray et al. [6] We have derived the following saddle­
point equations:
m = Z Dz f (z), ”
# = 1
p F
Z Dz z f (z), q = Z Dz [ f (z)] 2
E = ##
1 + # ”
#
, F = ## 2
[1 + # ”
#] 2 h 1 - 2m + q + 1
# s
i ,
(18)
where f (z) is the function defined by
f (z) = tanh p Fz - E f (z) + E  . (19)
f (z) is a single­valued function of z since E is positive. The overlap M is then calculated
by
M = Z Dz sgn f (z)
 . (20)
This is the second main result of this paper.
2 The proposal by Kechriotis and Manolakos [2] is to use the Hopfield model for an approximation
to the MAP demodulation. The proposal in this paper goes beyond theirs in that the analog­valued
Hopfield model is used to approximate not the MAP demodulator in the zero­temperature limit but
the MPM demodulators directly, including the optimal one.

4.6 AT instability
The AT instability [7] refers to the bifurcation of a saddle­point solution without replica
symmetry from the replica­symmetric one. In this paper we follow the usual convention
and assume that the first such destabilization occurs in the so­called ``replicon mode [8].''
As the stability condition of the RS saddle­point solution for the MPM demodulator, we
obtain
# - E 2 Z Dz sech 4 (
p Fz + E) = 0. (21)
For the MFA demodulator, we have
# - E 2 Z Dz " 1 - f (z) 2
1 + E(1 - f (z) 2 )
# 2
= 0. (22)
The RS solution is stable as long as the left­hand side of (21) or (22) is positive.
5 Performance evaluation
The saddle­point equations (13) and (18) can be solved numerically to evaluate the bit error
probability P b of the MPM demodulator and its naive mean­field approximation, respec­
tively. We have investigated four demodulators: the optimal one (# = # s ), MAP, MFA
(with # = # s , i.e., the naive mean­field approximation to the optimal one), and CD. The
results are summarized in Fig. 2 (a) and (b) for two cases with # s = 1 and 20, respectively.
Increasing # corresponds to relatively lowering the information bit rate, so that P b should
become small as # gets larger, which is in consistent with the general trend observed in
Fig. 2. The optimal demodulator shows consistently better performance than CD, as ex­
pected. The MAP demodulator marks almost the same performance as the optimal one
(indeed the result of the MAP demodulator is nearly the same as that of the optimal de­
modulator in the case # s = 1, so they are indistinguishable from each other in Fig. 2 (a)).
We also found that the performance of the optimal, MAP, and MFA demodulators is signif­
icantly improved in the large­# region when the variance # 2
s of the noise is small relative
to N , the number of the users. For example, in order to achieve practical level of bit error
probability, P b  10 -5 say, in the # s = 1 case the optimal and MAP demodulators allow
information bit rate 2 times faster than CD does. On the other hand, in the # s = 20 case
they allow information bit rate as much as 20 times faster than CD, which demonstrates that
significant process gain is achieved by the optimal and MAP demodulators in such cases.

The MFA demodulator with # = # s showed the performance competitive with the optimal
one for the # s = 1 case. Although the MFA demodulator fell behind the optimal and MAP
demodulators in the performance for the # s = 20 case, it still had process gain which al­
lows about 10 times faster information bit rate than CD does. Moreover, we observed, using
(22), that the RS saddle­point solution for the MFA demodulator with # = # s was stable
with respect to replica symmetry breaking (RSB), and thus RS ansatz was indeed valid
for the MFA solution. It suggests that the free energy landscape is rather simple for these
cases, making it easier for the MFA demodulator to find a good solution. This argument
provides an explanation as to why finite­temperature analog­valued Hopfield models, pro­
posed heuristically by Kechriotis and Manolakos [2], exhibited better performance in their
numerical experiments. We also found that the RS saddle­point solution for the optimal
demodulator was stable with respect to RSB over the whole range investigated, whereas
the solution for the MAP demodulator was found to be unstable. This observation suggests
the possibility to construct efficient near­optimal demodulators using advanced mean­field
approximations, such as the TAP approach [9, 10].
