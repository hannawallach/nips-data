Abstract
In this paper, we derive a second order mean field theory for directed
graphical probability models. By using an information theoretic argu≠
ment it is shown how this can be done in the absense of a partition
function. This method is a direct generalisation of the well≠known TAP
approximation for Boltzmann Machines. In a numerical example, it is
shown that the method greatly improves the first order mean field ap≠
proximation. For a restricted class of graphical models, so≠called single
overlap graphs, the second order method has comparable complexity to
the first order method. For sigmoid belief networks, the method is shown
to be particularly fast and effective.
1 Introduction
Recently, a number of authors have proposed deterministic methods for approximate infer≠
ence in large graphical models. The simplest approach gives a lower bound on the prob≠
ability of a subset of variables using Jenssen's inequality (Saul et al., 1996). The method
involves the minimization of the KL divergence between the target probability distribution
p and some 'simple' variational distribution q. The method can be applied to a large class
of probability models, such as sigmoid belief networks, DAGs and Boltzmann Machines
(BM).
For Boltzmann≠Gibbs distributions, it is possible to derive the lower bound as the first
term in a Taylor series expansion of the free energy around a factorized model. The free
energy is given by log Z, where Z is the normalization constant of the Boltzmann≠Gibbs
distribution: p(x) = exp( E(x))
Z . This Taylor series can be continued and the second order
term is known as the TAP correction (Plefka, 1982; Kappen and Rodríêguez, 1998). The
second order term significantly improves the quality of the approximation, but is no longer
a bound.
For probability distributions that are not Boltzmann≠Gibbs distributions, it is not obvious
how to obtain the second order approximation. However, there is an alternative way to
compute the higher order corrections, based on an information theoretic argument. Re≠
cently, this argument was applied to stochastic neural networks with asymmetric connec≠
tivity (Kappen and Spanjers, 1999). Here, we apply this idea to directed graphical models.

2 The method
Let x = (x 1 ; : : : ; xn ) be an n≠dimensional vector, with x i taking on discrete values. Let
p(x) be a directed graphical model on x. We will assume that p(x) can be written as a
product of potentials in the following way:
p(x) =
n
Y
k=1
p k (x k j k ) = exp
n
X
k=1
 k (x k ): (1)
Here, p k (x k j k ) denotes the conditional probability table of variable x k given the values
of its parents  k . x k = (x k ;  k ) denotes the subset of variables that appear in potential k
and  k (x k ) = log p k (x k j k ). Potentials can be overlapping, x k \ x l 6= ;, and x = [ k x k .
We wish to compute the marginal probability that x i has some specific value s i in the
presence of some evidence. We therefore denote x = (e; s) where e denote the subset of
variables that constitute the evidence, and s denotes the remainder of the variables. The
marginal is given as
p(s i je) =
p(s i ; e)
p(e)
: (2)
Both numerator and denominator contain sums over hidden states. These sums scale ex≠
ponentially with the size of the problem, and therefore the computation of marginals is
intractable.
We propose to approximate this problem by using a mean field approach. Consider a fac≠
torized distribution on the hidden variables h:
q(s) =
Y
i
q i (s i ) (3)
We wish to find the factorized distribution q that best approximates p(sje). Consider as a
distance measure
KL =
X
s
p(sje) log
 p(sje)
q(s)

: (4)
It is easy to see that the q that minimizes KL satisfies:
q(s i ) = p(s i je) (5)
We now think of the manifold of all probability distributions of the form Eq. 1, spanned
by the coordinates  k (x k ); k = 1; : : : ; m. For each k,  k (x k ) is a table of numbers,
indexed by x k . This manifold contains a submanifold of factorized probability distri≠
butions in which the potentials factorize:  k (x k ) =
P
i;i2k  ki (x i ). When in addition,
P
k;i2k  ki (x i ) = log q i (x i ); i 2 h, p(sje) reduces to q(s).
Assume now that p(sje) is somehow close to the factorized submanifold. The difference
p(s i je) = p(s i je) q i (s i ) is then small, and we can expand this small difference in terms
of changes in the parameters  k (x k ) =  k (x k ) log q(x k ); k = 1; : : : ; m:

The differentials are evaluated in the factorized distribution q. The left≠hand size of Eq. 6 is
zero because of Eq. 5 and we solve for q(s i ). This factorized distribution gives the desired
marginals up to the order of the expansion of  log p(s i je).
It is straightforward to compute the derivatives:
@ log p(s i je)
@ k (x k )

@ 2 log p(s i je)
@ k (x k )@ l (y l ) = p(x k ; 
y l js i ; e) p(x k ; 
y l je)
p(x k js i ; e)p(y l js i ; e) + p(x k je)p(y l je) (7)
We introduce the notation h: : :i s i
and h: : :i as the expectation values with respect to the
factorized distributions q(xjs i ; e) and q(xje), respectively. We define hh: : :ii s i
 h: : :i s i
h: : :i. We obtain

To first order, setting Eq. 8 equal to zero we obtain

in which the constants Z i follow from normalisation. The first order term is equivalent to
the standard mean field equations, obtained from Jensens' inequality.
The correction with second order terms is obtained in the same way, again dropping terms

were, again, the constants Z i follow from normalisation. These equations, which form the
main result of this paper, are generalization of the mean field equations with TAP correc≠
tions for directed graphical models. Both left and right≠hand size of Eqs. 10 and 11 depend
on the unknown probability distribution q(s) and can be solved by fixed point iteration.
3 Complexity and single≠overlap graphs
The complexity of the first order equations Eq. 10 is exponential in the number of variables
in the potentials  k of P : if the maximal clique size is c, then for each i we need of the
order of n i exp(c) computations, where n i is the number of cliques that contain node i.
The second term scales worse, since one must compute averages over the union of two
overlapping cliques and because of the double sum. However, things are not so bad. First

(ASIA)(Lauritzen and Spiegelhalter, 1988). Right: nodes within one potential a re grouped

of all, notice that the sum over k and l can be restricted to overlapping cliques (k \ l 6= ;)
and that i must be in either k or l or both (i 2 k [ l). Denote by n k the number of cliques
that have at least one variable in common with clique k and denote by n overlap = max k n k
Then, the sum over k and l contains not more than n i n overlap terms.
Each term is an average over the union of two cliques, which can be worse case of size 2c 1
(when only one variable is shared). However, since h k  l i s i
= hh k i k\l  l i s i
(hi k\l means expectation wrt q conditioned on the variables in k \ l) we can precompute
h k i k\l for all pairs of overlapping cliques k; l, for all states in k\l. Therefore, the worse
case complexity of the second order term is less than n i n overlap exp(c). Thus, we see that
the second order method has the same exponential complexity as the first order method, but
with a different polynomial prefactor. Therefore, the first or second order method can be
applied to directed graphical models as long as the number of parents is reasonably small.
The fact that the second order term has a worse complexity than the first order term is in
contrast to Boltzmann machines, in which the TAP approximation has the same complexity
as the standard mean field approximation. This phenomenon also occurs for a special class
of DAGs, which we call single≠overlap graphs. These are graphs in which the potentials  k
share at most one node. Figure 1 shows an example of a single≠overlap graph.
For single overlap graphs, we can use the first order result Eq. 9 to simplify the second
order correction. The derivation rather tedious and we just present the result

which has a complexity that is of order n i (c 1) exp(c). For probability distributions with
many small potentials that share nodes with many other potentials, Eq. 12 is more efficient
than Eq. 11. For instance, for Boltzmann Machines n i = n overlap = n 1 and c = 2. In
this case, Eq. 12 is identical to the TAP equations (Thouless et al., 1977).
4 Sigmoid belief networks
In this section, we consider sigmoid belief networks as an interesting class of directed
graphical models. The reason is, that one can expand in terms of the couplings instead of
the potentials which is more efficient. The sigmoid belief network is defined as

with m i = hs i i q  hs i i p and r is given by Eq. 15.
The different terms that appear in this equation can be easily interpreted. The first term
describes the lowest order forward influence on node i from its parents. Parents can be
either evidence or hidden nodes (fig. 2a). The second term is the bias  i . The third term
describes to lowest order the effect of Bayes' rule: it affects m i such that the observed
evidence on its children becomes most probable (fig. 2b). Note, that this term is absent
when the evidence is explained by the evidence nodes themselves: r(e k ) = 1. The fourth
and fifth terms are the quadratic contributions to the first and third terms, respectively. The
sixth term describes 'explaining away'. It describes the effect of hidden node l on node i,
when both have a common observed child k (fig. 2c). The last term describes the effect on
node i when its grandchild is observed (fig. 2d).
Note, that these equations are different from Eq. 10. When one applies Eq. 10 to sigmoid
belief networks, one requires additional approximations to compute hlog (x i h i )i (Saul
et al., 1996).

Since only feed≠forward connections are present, one can order the nodes such that w ij = 0
for i < j. Then the first order mean field equations can be solved in one single sweep
starting with node 1. The full second order equations can be solved by iteration, starting
with the first order solution.
5 Numerical results
We illustrate the theory with two toy problems. The first one is inference in Lauritzen's
chest clinic model (ASIA), defined on 8 binary variables x = fA; T ; S; L; B; E; X;Dg
(see figure 1, and (Lauritzen and Spiegelhalter, 1988) for more details about the model). We
computed exact marginals and approximate marginals using the approximating methods up
to first (Eq. 10) and second order (Eq. 11), respectively. The approximate marginals are
determined by sequential iteration of (10) and (11), starting at q(x i ) = 0:5 for all variables
i. The maximal error in the marginals using the first and second order method is 0.213
and 0.061, respectively. We verified that the single≠overlap expression Eq. 12 gave similar
results.
In fig. 3, we assess the accuracy and CPU time of the second order approximation Eq. 16
for sigmoid belief networks. We generate random fully connected sigmoid belief networks
with w ij from a normal distribution with mean zero and variance J 2 =n and  i = 0. We
observe in fig. 3b that the computation time is very fast: For n 1 = 500, we have obtained
convergence in 37 second on a Pentium 300 Mhz processor. The accuracy of the method
depends on the size of the weights and is computed for a network of n 1 = 10 (fig. 3c). In
(Kappen and Wiegerinck, 2001), we compare this approach to Saul's variational approach
(Saul et al., 1996) and show that our approach is much faster and slightly more accurate.

6 Discussion
In this paper, we computed a second order mean field approximation for directed graphical
models. We show that the second order approximation gives a significant improvement
over the first order result. The method does not use explicitly that the graph is directed.
Therefore, the result is equally valid for Markov graphs.
The complexity of the first and second order approximation is of O(n i exp(c)) and
O(n i n overlap exp(c)), respectively, with c the number of variables in the largest poten≠
tial. For single≠overlap graphs, one can rewrite the second order equation such that the
computational complexity reduces to O(n i (c 1) exp(c)). Boltzmann machines and the
Asia network are examples of single≠overlap graphs.
For large c, additional approximations are required, as was proposed by (Saul et al., 1996)
for the first order mean field equations. It is evident, that such additional approximations
are then also required for the second order mean field equations.
It has been reported (Barber and Wiegerinck, 1999; Wiegerinck and Kappen, 1999) that
similar numerical improvements can be obtained by using a very different approach, which
is to use an approximating distribution q that is not factorized, but still tractable. A promis≠
ing way to proceed is therefore to combine both approaches and to do a second order
expansion aroud a manifold of distributions with non≠factorized yet tractable distributions.
In this approach the sufficient statistics of the tractable structure is expanded, rather than
the marginal probabilities.
