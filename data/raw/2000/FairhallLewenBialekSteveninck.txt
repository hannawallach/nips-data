Abstract
Many neural systems extend their dynamic range by adaptation. We ex­
amine the timescales of adaptation in the context of dynamically mod­
ulated rapidly­varying stimuli, and demonstrate in the fly visual system
that adaptation to the statistical ensemble of the stimulus dynamically
maximizes information transmission about the time­dependent stimulus.
Further, while the rate response has long transients, the adaptation takes
place on timescales consistent with optimal variance estimation.
1 Introduction
Adaptation was one of the first phenomena discovered when Adrian recorded the responses
of single sensory neurons [1, 2]. Since that time, many different forms of adaptation have
been found in almost all sensory systems. The simplest forms of adaptation, such as light
and dark adaptation in the visual system, seem to involve just discarding a large constant
background signal so that the system can maintain sensitivity to small changes. The idea
of Attneave [3] and Barlow [4] that the nervous system tries to find an efficient representa­
tion of its sensory inputs implies that neural coding strategies should be adapted not just to
constant parameters such as the mean light intensity, but to the entire distribution of input
signals [5]; more generally, efficient strategies for processing (not just coding) of sensory
signals must also be matched to the statistics of these signals [6]. Adaptation to statistics
might happen on evolutionary time scales, or, at the opposite extreme, it might happen in
real time as an animal moves through the world. There is now evidence from several sys­
tems for real time adaptation to statistics [7, 8, 9], and at least in one case it has been shown
that the form of this adaptation indeed does serve to optimize the efficiency of represen­
tation, maximizing the information that a single neuron transmits about its sensory inputs
[10].
Perhaps the simplest of statistical adaptation experiments, as in Ref [7] and Fig. 1, is to
switch between stimuli that are drawn from different probability distributions and ask how
the neuron responds to the switch. When we `repeat' the experiment we repeat the time
dependence of the parameters describing the distribution, but we choose new signals from
the same distributions; thus we probe the response or adaptation to the distributions and not
to the particular signals. These switching experiments typically reveal transient responses
to the switch that have rather long time scales, and it is tempting to identify these long time
scales as the time scales of adaptation. On the other hand, one can also view the process
of adapting to a distribution as one of learning the parameters of that distribution, or of
accumulating evidence that the distribution has changed. Some features of the dynamics

in the switching experiments match the dynamics of an optimal statistical estimator [11],
but the overall time scale does not: for all the experiments we have seen, the apparent time
scales of adaptation in a switching experiment are much longer than would be required to
make reliable estimates of the relevant statistical parameters.
In this work we re­examine the phenomena of statistical adaptation in the motion sensitive
neurons of the fly visual system. Specifically, we are interested in adaptation to the vari­
ance or dynamic range of the velocity distribution [10]. It has been shown that, in steady
state, this adaptation includes a rescaling of the neuron's input/output relation, so that the
system seems to encode dynamic velocity signals in relative units; this allows the system,
presumably, to deal both with the  50 Æ =s motions that occur in straight flight and with the
 2000 Æ =s motions that occur during acrobatic flight (see Ref.[12]). Further, the precise
form of rescaling chosen by the fly's visual system is that which maximizes information
transmission. There are several natural questions: (1) How long does it take the system to
accomplish the rescaling of its input/output relation? (2) Are the transients seen in switch­
ing experiments an indication of gradual rescaling? (3) If the system adapts to the variance
of its inputs, is the neural signal ambiguous about the absolute scale of velocity? (4) Can
we see the optimization of information transmission occurring in real time?
2 Stimulus structure and experimental setup
A fly (Calliphora vicina) is immobilized in wax and views a computer controlled oscillo­
scope display while we record action potentials from the identified neuron H1 using stan­
dard methods. The stimulus movie is a random pattern of dark and light vertical bars, and
the entire pattern moves along a random trajectory with velocity S(t); since the neuron is
motion (and not position) sensitive we refer to this signal as the stimulus. We construct the
stimulus S(t) as the product of a normalized white noise s(t), constructed from a random
number sequence refreshed every  s = 2 ms, and an amplitude or standard deviation (t)
which varies on a characteristic timescale  a   s . Frames of the movie are drawn every
2 ms. For analysis all spike times are discretized at the 2 ms resolution of the movie.

3 Spike rate dynamics
Switching experiments as described above correspond to a stimulus such that the amplitude
(t) is a square wave, alternating between two values  1 and  2 ,  1 >  2 . Experiments
were performed over a range of switching periods (T = 40; 20; 10; 4 s), with the am­
plitudes  1 and  2 in a ratio of 5:1. Remarkably, the timescales of the response depend

strongly on those of the experiment; in fact, the response times rescale by T , as is seen
in Fig. 1(a). The decay of the rate in the first half of the experiment is fitted by an expo­
nential, and in Fig. 1(b), the resulting decay time (T ) is plotted as a function of T ; we
use an exponential not to insist that this is the correct form, only to extract a timescale. As
suggested by the rescaling of Fig. 1(a), the fitted decay times are well described as a linear
function of the stimulus period. This demonstrates that the timescale of adaptation of the
rate is not absolute, but is a function of the timescale established in the experiment.
Large sudden changes in stimulus variance might trigger special mechanisms, so we turn
to a signal that changes variance continuously: the amplitude (t) is taken to be the ex­
ponential of a sinusoid, (t) = exp(a sin(2kt)), where the period T = 1=k was varied
between 2 s and 240 s, and the constant a is fixed such that the amplitude varies by a factor
of 10 over a cycle. A typical averaged rate response to the exponential--sinusoidal stimulus
is shown in Fig. 2(a). The rate is close to sinusoidal over this parameter regime, indicating
a logarithmic encoding of the stimulus variance. Significantly, the rate response shows a
phase lead  with respect to the stimulus. This may be interpreted as the effect of adap­
tation: at every point on the cycle, the gain of the response is set to a value defined by the
stimulus a short time before.

noise stimulus s(t), averaged over presentations of s(t), and normalised by the mean and standard
deviation, for several periods T. (b) The time shift Æ between response and stimulus, for a range of
periods T .
As before, the response of the system was measured over a range of periods T . Fig. 2(b)
shows the measured relation of the timeshift Æ(T ) = T of the response as a function of
T . One observes that the relation is nearly linear over more than one order of magnitude in
T ; that is, the phase shift is approximately constant. Once again there is a strong and simple
dependence of the apparent timescale of adaptation on the stimulus parameters. Responses
to stimulus sequences composed of many frequencies also exhibit a phase shift, consistent
with that observed for the single frequency experiments.
4 The dynamic input­output relation
Both the switching and sinusoidally modulated experiments indicate that responses to
changing the variance of input signals have multiple time scales, ranging from a few sec­
onds to several minutes. Does it really take the system this long to adjust its input/output
relation to the new input distribution? In the range of velocities used, and at the contrast
level used in the laboratory, spiking in H1 depends on features of the velocity waveform
that occur within a window of  100 ms. After a few seconds, then, the system has had
access to several tens of independent samples of the motion signal, and should be able to
estimate its variance to within  20%; after a minute the precision would be better than
a few percent. In practice, we are changing the input variance not by a few percent but a

factor of two or ten; if the system were really efficient, these changes would be detected and
compensated by adaptation on much shorter time scales. To address this, we look directly
at the input/output relation as the standard deviation (t) varies in time.
For simplicity we analyze (as in Ref. [10]) features of the stimulus that modulate the
probability of occurrence of individual spikes, P (spikejstimulus); we will not consider
patterns of spikes, although the same methods can be easily generalised. The space of
stimulus histories of length  100 ms, discretised at 2 ms, leading up to a spike has a
dimensionality  50, too large to allow adequate sampling of P (spikejstimulus) from the
data, so we must begin by reducing the dimensionality of the stimulus description.
The simplest way to do so is to find a subset of directions in stimulus space determined to
be relevant for the system, and to project the stimulus onto that set of directions. These
directions correspond to linear filters. Such a set of directions can be obtained from the
moments of the spike­conditional stimulus; the first such moment is the spike­triggered
average, or reverse correlation function [2]. It has been shown [10] that for H1, under these
conditions, there are two relevant dimensions: a smoothed version of the velocity, and
also its derivative. The rescaling observed in steady state experiments was seen to occur
independently in both dimensions, so without loss of generality we will use as our filter the
single dimension given by the spike­triggered average. The stimulus projected onto this
filter will be denoted by s 0 .
The filtered stimulus is then passed through a nonlinear decision process akin to a threshold.
To calculate the input/output relation P (spikejs 0 ) [10], we use Bayes' rule:
P (spikejs 0 )
P (spike)
=
P (s 0 jspike)
P (s 0 )
: (1)
The spike rate r(s 0 ) is proportional to the probability of spiking, r(s 0 ) / P (spikejs 0 ),
leading to the relation
r(s 0 )

r
=
P (s 0 jspike)
P (s 0 )
; (2)
where  r is the mean spike rate. P (s 0 ) is the prior distribution of the projected stimulus,
which we know. The distribution P (s 0 jspike) is estimated from the projected stimulus
evaluated at the spike times, and the ratio of the two is the nonlinear input/output relation.
A number of experiments have shown that the filter characteristics of H1 are adaptive, and
we see this in the present experiments as well: as the amplitude (t) is decreased, the filter
changes both in overall amplitude and shape. The filter becomes increasingly extended:
the system integrates over longer periods of time under conditions of low velocities. Thus
the filter depends on the input variance, and we expect that there should be an observable
relaxation of the filter to its new steady state form after a switch in variance. We find,
however, that within 200 ms following the switch, the amplitude of the filter has already
adjusted to the new variance, and further that the detailed shape of the filter has attained
its steady state form in less than 1 s. The precise timescale of the establishment of the
new filter shape depends on the value of : for the change to  1 , the steady state form is
achieved within 200 ms. The long tail of the low variance filter for  2 (<  1 ) is established
more slowly. Nonetheless, these time scales which characterize adaptation of the filter are
much shorter than the rate transients seen in the switching experiments, and are closer to
what we might expect for an efficient estimator.
We construct time dependent input/output relations by forming conditional distributions us­
ing spikes from particular time slices in a periodic experiment. In Figs. 3.1(b) and 3.1(c),
we show the input/output relation calculated in 1 s bins throughout the switching experi­
ment. Within the first second the input/output relation is almost indistinguishable from its
steady state form. Further, it takes the same form for the two halves of the experiment: it is
rescaled by the standard deviation, as was seen for the steady state experiments. The close
collapse or rescaling of the input/output relations depends not only on the normalisation by
the standard deviation, but also on the use of the ''local'' adapted filter (i.e. measured in the
same time bin). Returning to the sinusoidal experiments, the input/output relations were

Figure 3: Input/output relations for (a) switching, (b) sinusoidal and (c) randomly modulated exper­
iments. Figs. 3.1 show the modulation envelope (t), in log for (b) and (c) (solid), and the measured
rate (dotted), normalised by mean and standard deviation. Figs. 3.2 show input/output relations
calculated in non­overlapping bins throughout the stimulus cycle, with the input s0 in units of the
standard deviation of the whole stimulus. Figs. 3.3 show the input/output relations with the input
rescaled to units of the local standard deviation.
constructed for T = 45 s in 20 non­overlapping bins of width 2.25 s. Once again the func­
tions show a remarkable rescaling which is sharpened by the use of the appropriate local
filter: see Fig.3.2(b) and (c). Finally, we consider an amplitude which varies randomly with
correlation time    3 s: (t) is a repeated segment of the exponential of a Gaussian ran­
dom process, pictured in Fig.3.3(a), with periodicity T = 90s    . Dividing the stimulus
into sequential bins of 2 s in width, we obtain the filters for each timeslice, and calculate
the local prior distributions, which are not Gaussian in this case as they are distorted by the
local variations of (t). Nonetheless, the ratio P (s 0 jspike)=P (s 0 ) conspires such that the
form of the input/output relation is preserved.
In all three cases, our results show that the system rapidly and continuously adjusts its
coding strategy, rescaling the input/output relation with respect to the local variance of the
input as for steady state stimuli. Variance normalisation occurs as rapidly as is measurable,
and the system chooses a similar form for the input/output relation in each case.
5 Information transmission
What does this mean for the coding efficiency of the neuron? An experiment was designed
to track the information transmission as a function of time. We use a small set of N 2 s
long random noise sequences fs i (t)g, i = 1; : : : ; N , presented in random order at two

different amplitudes,  1 and  2 . We then ask how much information the spike train conveys
about (a) which of the random segments s i (t) and (b) which of the amplitudes  j was
used. Specifically, the experiment consists of a series of trials of length 2 s where the fast
component is one of the sequences fs i g, and after 1 s, the amplitude switches from  1 to
 2 or vice versa. N was taken to be 40, so that a 2 hour experiment provides approximately
80 samples for each (s i ;  j ). This allows us to measure the mutual information between
the response and either the fast or the slow component of the stimulus as a function of time
across the 2 s repeated segment. We use only a very restricted subspace of  and s: the
maximum available information about  is 1 bit, and about s is log 2 N .
The spike response is represented by ``words'' [13], generated from the spike times discre­
tised to timebins of 2 ms, where no spike is represented by 0, and a spike by 1. A word
is defined as the binary digit formed from 10 consecutive bins, so there are 2 10 possible
words. The information about the fast component s in trials of a given  is
I  (w(t); s) = H [P  (w(t))]
N
X
j=1
P (s j )H [P  (w(t); s j )]; (3)
where H is the entropy of the word distribution:
H [P (w(t))] =
X
k
P (w k (t)) log 2 P (w k (t)): (4)
One can compare this information for different values of . Similarly, one can calculate
the information about the amplitude using a given probe s:
I s (w(t); ) = H [P s (w(t))]
2
X
j=1
P ( j )H [P s (w(t);  j )]: (5)
The amount of information for each s j varies rapidly depending on the presence or absence
of spikes, so we average these contributions over the fs j g to give I(w; ).
Figure 4: Information per spike as a function of time where  is switched every 2 s.
The mutual information as a function of time is shown in Fig. 4, presented as bits/spike.
As one would expect, the amount of information transmitted per second about the stimulus
details, or s, depends on the ensemble parameter : larger velocities allow a higher SNR
for velocity estimation, and the system is able to transmit more information. However,

when we convert the information rate to bits/spike, we find that the system is transmitting
at a constant efficiency of around 1.4 bits/spike. Any change in information rate during a
switch from  1 to  2 is undetectable. For a switch from  2 to  1 , the time to recovery is
of order 100 ms. This demonstrates explicitly that the system is indeed rapidly maximising
its information transmission. Further, the transient ''excess'' of spikes following an upward
switch provide information at a constant rate per spike. The information about the ampli­
tude, similarly, remains at a constant level throughout the trial. Thus, information about the
ensemble variable is retained at all times: the response is not ambiguous with respect to the
absolute scale of velocity. Despite the rescaling of input/output curves, responses within
different ensembles are distinguishable.
6 Discussion
We find that the neural response to a stimulus with well­separated timescales S(t) =
(t)s(t) takes the form of a
rate
 timing code, where the response r(t) may be approxi­
mately modelled as
r(t) = R[(t)]g (s(t)) : (6)
Here R modulates the overall rate and depends on the slow dynamics of the variance enve­
lope, while the precise timing of a given spike in response to fast events in the stimulus is
determined by the nonlinear input/output relation g, which depends only on the normalised
quantity s(t). Through this apparent normalisation by the local standard deviation, g, as for
steady­state experiments, maximises information transmission about the fast components
of the stimulus. The function R modulating the rate varies on much slower timescales so
cannot be taken as an indicator of the extent of the system's adaptation to a new ensemble.
Rather, R appears to function as an independent degree of freedom, capable of transmitting
information, at a slower rate, about the slow stimulus modulations. The presence of many
timescales in R may itself be an adaptation to the many timescales of variation in natural
signals. At the same time, the rapid readjustment of the input/output relation -- and the
consequent recovery of information after a sudden change in  -- indicate that the adaptive
mechanisms approach the limiting speed set by the need to gather statistics.
