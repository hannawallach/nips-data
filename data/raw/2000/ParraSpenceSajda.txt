Abstract
We present evidence that several higher-order statistical proper-
ties of natural images and signals can be explained by a stochastic
model which simply varies scale of an otherwise stationary Gaus-
sian process. We discuss two interesting consequences. The rst
is that a variety of natural signals can be related through a com-
mon model of spherically invariant random processes, which have
the attractive property that the joint densities can be constructed
from the one dimensional marginal. The second is that in some cas-
es the non-stationarity assumption and only second order methods
can be explicitly exploited to nd a linear basis that is equivalent
to independent components obtained with higher-order methods.
This is demonstrated on spectro-temporal components of speech.
1 Introduction
Recently, considerable attention has been paid to understanding and modeling the
non-Gaussian or \higher-order" properties of natural signals, particularly images.
Several non-Gaussian properties have been identied and studied. For example,
marginal densities of features have been shown to have high kurtosis or \heavy
tails", indicating a non-Gaussian, sparse representation. Another example is the
\bow-tie" shape of conditional distributions of neighboring features, indicating de-
pendence of variances [11]. These non-Gaussian properties have motivated a number
of image and signal processing algorithms that attempt to exploit higher-order s-
tatistics of the signals, e.g., for blind source separation. In this paper we show
that these previously observed higher-order phenomena are ubiquitous and can be
accounted for by a model which simply varies the scale of an otherwise station-
ary Gaussian process. This enables us to relate a variety of natural signals to one
another and to spherically invariant random processes, which are well-known in
the signal processing literature [6, 3]. We present analyses of several kinds of data

from this perspective, including images, speech, magnetoencephalography (MEG)
activity, and socio-economic data (e.g., stock market data). Finally we present the
results of experiments with algorithms for nding a linear basis equivalent to inde-
pendent components that exploit non-stationarity so as to require only 2nd-order
statistics. This simplication is possible whenever linearity and non-stationarity of
independent sources is guaranteed such as for the powers of acoustic signals.
2 Scale non-stationarity and high kurtosis
Natural signals can be non-stationary in various ways, e.g. varying powers, changing
correlation of neighboring samples, or even non-stationary higher moments. We will
concentrate on the simplest possible variation and show in the following sections
how it can give rise to many higher-order properties observed in natural signals.
We assume that at any given instance a signal is specied by a probability density
function with zero mean and unknown scale or power. The signal is assumed non-
stationary in the sense that its power varies from one time instance to the next. 1
We can think of this as a stochastic process with samples z(t) drawn from a zero
mean distribution p z (z) with samples possibly correlated in time. We observe a
scaled version of this process with time varying scales s(t) > 0 sampled from p s (s),
x(t) = s(t)z(t) ; (1)
The observable process x(t) is distributed according to
p x (x) =
Z 1
0
ds p s (s) p x (xjs) =
Z 1
0
ds p s (s) s 1 p z ( x
s
): (2)
We refer to p x (x) as the long-term distribution and p z (z) as the instantaneous
distribution. In essence p x (x) is a mixture distribution with innitely many kernels
s 1 p z ( x
s ). We would like to relate the sparseness of p z (z), as measured by the
kurtosis, to the sparseness of the observable distribution p x (x).
Kurtosis is dened as the ratio between the fourth and second cumulant of a distri-
bution [7]. As such it measures the length of the distribution's tails, or the sharpness
of its mode. For a zero mean random variable x this reduces up to a constant to
K[x]
=
 x 4

x
hx 2 i 2
x
, with hf(x)i x =
Z
dxf(x)p x (x) : (3)
In this case we nd that the kurtosis of the long-term distribution is always larger
than the kurtosis of the instantaneous distribution unless the scale is stationary ([9]
and [1] for symmetric p z (z)),
K[x]  K[z] : (4)
To see this note that the independence of s and z implies, hx n i x = hs n i s hz n i z , and
therefore, K[x] =
K[z]
 s 4

s
=
 s 2
 2
s . From the
inequality,
 (s 2 c 2 ) 2

s  0, which
hold for any arbitrary constant c > 0, it is easy to show
that
 s 4

s

 s 2
 2
s , where
the equality holds for p s (s) = Æ(s c). Together this leads to inequality (4), which
states that for a xed scale s(t), i.e. the magnitude of the signal is stationary, the
kurtosis will be minimal. Conversely, non-stationary signals, dened as a variable
scaling of an otherwise stationary process, will have increased kurtosis.
1 Throughout this paper we will refer to signals that are sampled in time. Note that
all the arguments apply equally well to a spatial rather than temporal sampling, that is,
images rather than time series.

Figure 1: Marginal distributions within 3 standard deviations are shown on a log-
arithmic scale; left to right: natural image features, speech sound intensities, stock
market variation, MEG alpha activity. The measured kurtosis is 4.5, 16.0, 12.9, and
5.3 respectively. On top the empirical histograms are presented and on bottom the
model distributions. The speech data has been t with a Meijer-G function G 20
02 [3].
For the MEG activity, the stock market data and the image features a mixture of
zero mean Gaussians was used.
Figure 1 shows empirical plots of the marginal distributions for four natural signals;
image, speech, stock market, and MEG data. As image feature we used a wavelet
component for a 162x162 natural texture image of sand (presented in [4]). Self-
inverting wavelets with a down-sampling factor of three where used. The speech
signal is a 2.3 s recording of a female speaker sampled at 8 kHz with a noise level
less than -25 dB. The signal has been band limited between 300Hz and 3.4 kHz cor-
responding to telephone speech. The market data are the daily closing values of the
NY Stock exchange composite index from 02/01/1990 to 04/28/2000. We analyzed
the variation from the one day linear prediction value to remove the upwards trend
of the last decade. The MEG data is band-passed (10-12 Hz) alpha activity of a in-
dependent component of 122 MEG signals. This independendt component exhibits
alpha de-synchronization for a visio-motor integration task [10]. One can see that
in all four cases the kurtosis is high relative to a Gaussian (K = 3). Our claim is
that for natural signals, high kurtosis is a natural result of the scale non-stationarity
of the signal. Additional evidence comes from the behavior seen in the conditional
histograms of the joint distributions, presented in the next section.
3 Higher-order properties of joint densities
It has been observed in images that the conditional histograms of joint densities
from neighboring features (neighboring in scale, space, and/or orientation) exhibit
variance dependencies that cannot be accounted for by simple second-order model-
s [11]. Figure 2 shows empirical conditional histograms for the four types of natural
signals we considered earlier. One can see that speech and stock-market data exhibit
the same variance dependency or \bow-tie" shape exhibited by images.

Figure 2: (Top) Empirical conditional histograms and (bottom) model conditional
density derived from the one dimensional marginals presented in the previous gure
assuming the data is sampled form a SIRP. Good correspondence validates the SIRP
assumption which is equivalent to our non-stationary scale model for slow varying
scales.
The model of Equation 1 can easily account for this observation if we assume slowly
changing scales s(t). A possible explanation is that neighboring samples or features
exhibit a common scale. If two zero mean stochastic variables are scaled both with
the same factors their magnitude and variance will increase together. That is, as
the magnitudes of one variable increase so will the magnitude and the variance of
the other variable. This results in a broadening of the histogram of one variable
as one increases the value of the conditioning variable | resulting in a \bow-tie"
shaped conditional density.
4 Relationship to spherical invariant random process
A closely related class of signals to those in Equation 1 is the so-called Spherical
Invariant Random Process (SIRP). If the signals are short time Gaussian and the
powers vary slowly the class of signals described are approximately SIRPs. Despite
the restriction to Gaussian distributed z SIRPs have been shown to be a good
model for a range of stochastic processes with very dierent higher-order properties,
depending on the scale distributions p s (s). They have been used in a variety of signal
processing applications [6]. Band-limited speech, in particular, has been shown to
be well described by SIRPs [3]. If z is multidimensional, such as a window of samples
in a time series or a multi-dimensional feature vector, one talks about Spherically
Invariant Random Vectors SIRVs. Natural images have been modeled by what in
essence is closely related to SIRVs | a innite mixture of zero mean Gaussian
features [11]. Similar models have also been used for nancial time series [2].
The fundamental property of SIRPs is that the joint distribution of a SIRP is
entirely dened by a univariate characteristic function C x (u) and the covariance 
of neighboring samples [6]. They are directly related to our scale-non-stationarity
model through a theorem by Kingman and Yao which states that any SIRP is

equivalent to a zero mean Gaussian process z(t) with an independent stochastic
scale s. Furthermore the univariate characteristic function C x (u) species p s (s)
and the 1D marginal p x (x) and visa versa [6]. From the characteristic function
C x (u) and the covariance  one can also construct all higher dimensional joint
densities. This leads to the following relation between the marginal densities of
various orders [3],
pn (x) =  n=2 fn (x T  1 x); with x 2 R n , and 
=
 xx T 
; (5)
fn+2 (s) = d
ds fn (s) ; f 2m (s) =  1=2
Z 1
1
f 2m+1 (s + y 2 ) dy (6)
In particular these relations allow us to compute the joint density p 2 (x(t); x(t + 1))
from an empirically estimated marginal density p 1 (x(t)) and the covariance of x(t)
and x(t+1). Comparing the resulting 2D joint density to the observed joint density
allows to us verify the assumption that the data is sampled from a SIRP. In so doing
we can more rmly assert that the observed two dimensional joint histograms can
in fact be explained as a Gaussian process with a non-stationary scale.
If we use zero mean Gaussian mixtures, p 1 (x) = P K
i=1 m i exp( x 2 = 2
i ), as the
1D model distribution the resulting 2D joint distribution is simply pn (x) =
P K
i=1 m i exp( x T  1 x= 2
i ). If the model density is given by a Meijer-G func-
tion, as suggested in [3] with p 1 (x) = 
2 () G 20
02 ( 2 x 2 j 0:5;  0:5), then the 2D
joint is p 2 (x) =  2
p  2 () G 30
13 ( 2 x T  1 xj 0:5; 0; ; ). In both cases it is assumed
that the data is normalized to unit variance.
Brehm has used this approach to demonstrate that band-limited speech is well de-
scribed by a SIRP [3]. In addition, we show here that the same is true for the image
features and stock market data presented above. The model conditional densities
shown in Figure 2 correspond well with the empirical conditional histograms. In
particular they exhibit the characteristic bow-tie structure. We emphasize that
these model 2D joint densities have been obtained only from the 1D marginal of
Figure 1 and the covariance of neighboring samples.
The deviations of the observed and model 2D joint distributions are likely due to
variable covariance itself, that is, not only does the overall scale or power vary
with time, but the components of the covariance matrix vary independently of each
other. For example in speech the covariance of neighboring samples is well known to
change considerably over time. Nevertheless, the surprising result is that a simple
scale non-stationarity model can reproduce the higher-order statistical properties
in a variety of natural signals.
5 Spectro-temporal linear basis for speech
As an example of the utility of this non-stationarity assumption, we analyze the
statistical properties of the powers of a single source, in particular for speech signals.
Motivated by the auditory spectro-temporal receptive eld reported in [5] and work
on receptive elds and independent components we are interested to nd a linear
basis of independent components in a spectro-temporal window of speech signals.
In [9, 8] we show that one can use second order statistic to uniquely recover sources
from a mixture provided that the mix is linear and the sources are non-stationary.
One can do so by nding a basis that guarantees uncorrelated signals at multiple
time intervals (multiple decorrelation algorithm (MDA)). Our present model argues
that features of natural signals such as the powers in dierent frequency bands can
be assumed non-stationary, while powers of independent signals are known to add

direction corresponds to 16 ms. In the vertical direction 21 Bark scale power bands
are displayed. The upper diagram shows the log-powers for a 2.5 s segment of the
200 s recording used to compute the dierent linear bases. The three lower diagrams
show three sets of 15 linear basis components for 21x8 spectro-temporal segments of
the speech powers. The sets correspond to PCA, MDA, and ICA respectively. Note
that these are not log-powers, hence the smaller contribution of the high frequencies

linearly. We should be able therefore to identify with second order methods the
same linear components as with independent component algorithms where high-
order statistical assumptions are invoked.
We compute the powers in 21 frequency bands on a Bark scale for short consecutive
time intervals. We choose to nd a basis for a segment of 21 bands and 8 neighbor-
ing time slices corresponding to 128 ms of signal between 0 and 4 kHz. We used half
overlapping windows of 256 samples such that for a 8 kHz signal neighboring time
slices are 16 ms apart. A set of 7808 such spectro-temporal segments were sampled
from 200 s of the same speech data presented previously. Figure 3 shows the results
obtained for a subspace of 15 components. One can see that the components ob-
tained with MDA are quite similar to the result of ICA and dier considerably from
the principal components. From this we conclude that speech powers can in fact
be thought of as a linear combination of non-stationary independent components.
In general, the point we wish to make is to demonstrate the strength of second-
order methods when the assumptions of non-stationarity, independence, and linear
superposition are met.

6 Conclusion
We have presented evidence that several high-order statistical properties of natural
signals can be explained by a simple scale non-stationary model. For four types of
natural signals, we have shown that a scale non-stationary model will reproduce the
high-kurtosis behavior of the marginal densities. Furthermore, for the case of scale
non-stationary with Gaussian density (SIRP), we have shown that we can reproduce
the variance dependency seen in conditional histograms of the joint density directly
from the empirical marginal densities. This leads to the conclusion that a scale non-
stationary model (e.g. SIRP) is a good model for these natural signals. We have
shown that one can exploit the assumptions of this model to compute a linear basis
for natural signals without having to invoke higher order statistically techniques.
Though we do not claim that all higher-order properties or all natural signals can
be explained by a scale non-stationary model, it is remarkable that such a simple
model can account for a variety of the higher-order phenomena and for a variety of
signal types.
